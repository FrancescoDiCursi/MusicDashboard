I never help my neighbor
Never do what is proper
For my fair share of labor.

I'm a poor boy
And I'm a rover
Count your coins and
Throw them over my shoulder
I may grow older
Nobody knows
How cold it grows
And nobody sees
How shaky my knees
Nobody cares
How steep my stairs
And nobody smiles
If I cross their stiles.

Oh poor boy
So sorry for himself
Oh poor boy
So worried for his health.
You may say every day
Where will he stay tonight.

Never know what I came for
Seems that I've forgotten
Never ask what I came for
Or how I was begotten.

I'm a poor boy
And I'm a ranger
Things I say
May seem stranger than Sunday
Changing to Monday.
Nobody knows
How cold it flows
And nobody feels
The worn down heels
Nobody's eyes
Make the skies
Nobody spreads
Their aching heads.

Oh poor boy
So worried for his life
Oh poor boy
So keen to take a wife.

He's a mess but he'll say yes
If you just dress in white.

Nobody knows 
How cold it blows
And nobody sees
How shaky my knees
Nobody cares
How steep my stairs
And nobody smiles
If you cross their stiles.

Oh poor boy
So sorry for himself
Oh poor boy
So worried for his health.
You may say every day

And so secure amongst the books and all the records of your lifetime.

Is part of a chain

Now take a little while to make your story clear.

Your feet from the ground
Weigh up your anchor

Get on your knees
Pray for warmth and green paper.
A city drought

You're down and out
See your trousers don't taper.
Saddle up
Kick your feet

Ride the range of a London street
Travel to a local plane
Turn around and come back again.

And at the chime of the city clock
Put up your road block
Hang on to your crown.
For a stone in a tin can
Is wealth to the city man
Who leaves his armor down.

Stay indoors
Beneath the floors
Talk with neighbors only.
The games you play

Make people say
You're either weird or lonely.
A city star
Won't shine too far

On account of the way you are
And the beads
Around your face
Make you sure to fit back in place.

And at the beat of the city drum
See how your friends come in twos;
Or threes or more.
For the sound of a busy place

Is fine for a pretty face
Who knows what a face is for.

The city clown
Will soon fall down
Without a face to hide in.
And he will lose

If he won't choose
The one he may confide in.
Sonny boy
With smokes for sale

Went to ground with a face so pale
And never heard
About the change
Showed his hand and fell out of range.

In the light of a city square
Find out the face that's fair
Keep it by your side.
When the light of the city falls
You fly to the city walls
Take off with your bride.

Slow, slow, Jane, cross the fence.

Do you feel like a remnant
Of something that's past
Do you find things are moving
Just a little too fast.
Do you hope to find new ways
Of quenching your thirst,
Do you hope to find new ways
Of doing better than your worst.

Slow, slow Jane, we're on the move.

Do it for you,
Sure that you would do the same for me one day.

Even if it's only in your hazey way.

Can you tell if you're moving
With no mirror to see,
If you're just riding a new man
Looks a little like me.
Is it all so confusing,
Is it hard to believe
When the winter is coming

So far away, so long ago it seems
The memory comes of a distant beach
Pale sand stretching far from reach
It was then I found my princess of the sand

As I traced the foam, pebbles beneath my feet
I looked behind, I saw this one so sweet
She came to me and I saw in her eyes
The heavy toll of a thousand eyes
I called her my princess of the sand

She stared at me and my mind was in a maze
As we moved along in a summer sea-dream haze
She moved her mouth but there came no sound
The message she brought can never be found
But I called her my princess of the sand

One moment we walked with the night breeze in our face
Then I looked, she'd gone of her presence, there was no trace
Where she went or came from who can know
Or if she'll ever return to help me know
Who she is, my princess of the sand

Sometime when the summer nights come back
I'll go back to the sea, follow that sandy track

Don't name the day or try to say
It happened before.

His shed to mend,

And so secure amongst the books and all the records of your lifetime.

Now take a little while to make your story clear.

Pray for warmth and green paper.

You're down and out
See your trousers don't taper.

Kick your feet

Ride the range of a London street
Travel to a local plane
Turn around and come back again.

And at the chime of the city clock
Put up your road block

For a stone in a tin can
Is wealth to the city man
Who leaves his armor down.

Stay indoors
Beneath the floors
Talk with neighbors only.
The games you play

Make people say
You're either weird or lonely.
A city star
Won't shine too far

On account of the way you are
And the beads
Around your face
Make you sure to fit back in place.

And at the beat of the city drum
See how your friends come in twos;
Or threes or more.
For the sound of a busy place

Is fine for a pretty face
Who knows what a face is for.

The city clown
Will soon fall down
Without a face to hide in.
And he will lose

If he won't choose
The one he may confide in.
Sonny boy
With smokes for sale

Went to ground with a face so pale
And never heard
About the change
Showed his hand and fell out of range.

In the light of a city square
Find out the face that's fair
Keep it by your side.
When the light of the city falls
You fly to the city walls
Take off with your bride.

A sign of the times today
And hearing no bell from a steeple tall
People all in dismay
Falling so far on a silver spoon
Making the moon for fun
And changing a rope for a size too small
People all get hung.

Ive got opium in my chimney
No other life to choose
Nightmare made of hash dreams.
Got the devil in my shoes

Well when Im smoking
Put my worries on a shelf
Dont think about nothin
Try not to see myself.

Well in this blues Im singin
Theres a lesson to be learned

So far away, so long ago it seems
The memory comes of a distant beach
Pale sand stretching far from reach
It was then I found my princess of the sand

As I traced the foam, pebbles beneath my feet
I looked behind, I saw this one so sweet
She came to me and I saw in her eyes
The heavy toll of a thousand eyes
I called her my princess of the sand

She stared at me and my mind was in a maze
As we moved along in a summer sea-dream haze
She moved her mouth but there came no sound
The message she brought can never be found
But I called her my princess of the sand

One moment we walked with the night breeze in our face
Then I looked, she'd gone of her presence, there was no trace
Where she went or came from who can know
Or if she'll ever return to help me know
Who she is, my princess of the sand

Sometime when the summer nights come back
I'll go back to the sea, follow that sandy track
I'll look around, hope to find

Get on your knees
Pray for warmth and green paper.
A city drought

You're down and out
See your trousers don't taper.
Saddle up
Kick your feet

Ride the range of a London street
Travel to a local plane
Turn around and come back again.

And at the chime of the city clock
Put up your road block
Hang on to your crown.
For a stone in a tin can
Is wealth to the city man
Who leaves his armor down.

Stay indoors
Beneath the floors
Talk with neighbors only.
The games you play

Make people say
You're either weird or lonely.
A city star
Won't shine too far

On account of the way you are
And the beads
Around your face
Make you sure to fit back in place.

And at the beat of the city drum
See how your friends come in twos;
Or threes or more.
For the sound of a busy place

Is fine for a pretty face
Who knows what a face is for.

The city clown
Will soon fall down
Without a face to hide in.
And he will lose

If he won't choose
The one he may confide in.
Sonny boy
With smokes for sale

Went to ground with a face so pale
And never heard
About the change
Showed his hand and fell out of range.

In the light of a city square
Find out the face that's fair
Keep it by your side.
When the light of the city falls
You fly to the city walls
Take off with your bride.

But at the chime of a city clock
Put up your road block
Hang on to your crown.

I never help my neighbor
Never do what is proper
For my fair share of labor.

I'm a poor boy
And I'm a rover
Count your coins and
Throw them over my shoulder
I may grow older
Nobody knows
How cold it grows
And nobody sees
How shaky my knees
Nobody cares
How steep my stairs
And nobody smiles
If I cross their stiles.

Oh poor boy
So sorry for himself
Oh poor boy
So worried for his health.
You may say every day
Where will he stay tonight.

Never know what I came for
Seems that I've forgotten
Never ask what I came for
Or how I was begotten.

I'm a poor boy
And I'm a ranger
Things I say
May seem stranger than Sunday
Changing to Monday.
Nobody knows
How cold it flows
And nobody feels
The worn down heels
Nobody's eyes
Make the skies
Nobody spreads
Their aching heads.

Oh poor boy
So worried for his life
Oh poor boy
So keen to take a wife.

He's a mess but he'll say yes
If you just dress in white.

Nobody knows 
How cold it blows
And nobody sees
How shaky my knees
Nobody cares
How steep my stairs
And nobody smiles
If you cross their stiles.

So far away, so long ago it seems
The memory comes of a distant beach
Pale sand stretching far from reach
It was then I found my princess of the sand

As I traced the foam, pebbles beneath my feet
I looked behind, I saw this one so sweet
She came to me and I saw in her eyes
The heavy toll of a thousand eyes
I called her my princess of the sand

She stared at me and my mind was in a maze
As we moved along in a summer sea-dream haze
She moved her mouth but there came no sound
The message she brought can never be found
But I called her my princess of the sand

One moment we walked with the night breeze in our face
Then I looked, she'd gone of her presence, there was no trace
Where she went or came from who can know
Or if she'll ever return to help me know
Who she is, my princess of the sand

I'll go back to the sea, follow that sandy track

Then you find you jumped the gun
Have to go back where you begun

When the day is done, when the night is cold
Some get by but some get old
Just to show life's not made of gold
When the night is cold

When the bird has flown
Got no-one to call your own
No place to call your home
Now the bird has flown

When the game's been fought
Newspaper blown across the court
Lost much sooner than you would have thought 
Now the game's been fought

When the party's through
Seems so very sad for you
Didn't do the things you meant to do
Now there's no time to start anew
Now the party's through

She came to me and I saw in her eyes
The heavy toll of a thousand eyes
I called her my princess of the sand

As we moved along in a summer sea-dream haze
She moved her mouth but there came no sound
The message she brought can never be found
But I called her my princess of the sand

One moment we walked with the night breeze in our face
Then I looked, she'd gone of her presence, there was no trace
Where she went or came from who can know
Or if she'll ever return to help me know
Who she is, my princess of the sand

No place to call your home

Newspaper blown across the court

Go out to fight

You sail to the sky
On the crest of a wave

With the teeth that bite so sharp when you're not looking in the evening

And all the friends that you once knew are left behind they kept you safe
And so secure amongst the books and all the records of your lifetime

What will happen

Hey, take a little while to grow your brother's hair
And now, take a little while to make your sister fair
And now that the family
Is part of a chain
Take off your eye shade
Start over again

Now take a little while to find your way in here
Now take a little while to make your story clear
Now that you're lifting
Your feet from the ground
Weigh up your anchor
And never look round

Let's sing a song 
For Hazy Jane
She's back again in my mind

With the teeth that bite so sharp when you're not looking in the evening.

And all the friends that you once knew are left behind they kept you safe
And so secure amongst the books and all the records of your lifetime.

When the world it gets so crowded that you can't look out the window

And now, take a little while to make your sister fair.
And now that the family
Is part of a chain
Take off your eye shade
Start over again.

Now take a little while to make your story clear.
Now that you're lifting
Your feet from the ground
Weigh up your anchor
And never look round.

With the teeth that bite so sharp when you're not looking in the evening.

And all the friends that you once knew are left behind they kept you safe
And so secure amongst the books and all the records of your lifetime.

In the morning
When the world it gets so crowded that you can't look out the window
In the morning.

And now, take a little while to make your sister fair.
And now that the family
Is part of a chain
Take off your eye shade
Start over again.

Now take a little while to find your way in here
Now take a little while to make your story clear.
Now that you're lifting
Your feet from the ground
Weigh up your anchor
And never look round.

Go out to fight

You sail to the sky
On the crest of a wave

For lilac time.

About the way his river flows
And all night shows
In summertime.

For the sky to blow away
Or maybe stay
She wasn't sure.

For when she thought of summer rain
Calling for her mind again
She lost the pain
And stayed for more.

Going to tell him all I can
About the ban
On feeling free.

So pale and sincere

You have nothing to fear
For the dreams that came to you when so young
Told of a life
Where spring is sprung

In the cold of the night
When the armies of emotion
Go out to fight
But while the earth sinks to its grave
You sail to the sky
On the crest of a wave

So forget this cruel world
Where I belong
I'll just sit and wait
And sing my song
And if one day you should see me in the crowd
Lend a hand and lift me

Nobody's eyes
Make the skies
Nobody spreads
Their aching heads.

So crowded that you can't look out the window in the morning.

What will happen in the evening in the forest with the weasel
With the teeth that bite so sharp when you're not looking in the evening.

And all the friends that you once knew are left behind they kept you safe
And so secure amongst the books and all the records of your lifetime.

What will happen
In the morning
When the world it gets so crowded that you can't look out the window
In the morning.

Hey, take a little while to grow your brother's hair
And now, take a little while to make your sister fair.
And now that the family
Is part of a chain
Take off your eye shade
Start over again.

Now take a little while to find your way in here
Now take a little while to make your story clear.
Now that you're lifting
Your feet from the ground
Weigh up your anchor
And never look round.

Never ask what I came for
Or how I was begotten.

I'm a poor boy
And I'm a ranger
Things I say
May seem stranger than Sunday
Changing to Monday.
Nobody knows
How cold it flows
And nobody feels
The worn down heels
Nobody's eyes
Make the skies
Nobody spreads
Their aching heads.

Oh poor boy
So worried for his life
Oh poor boy
So keen to take a wife.

He's a mess but he'll say yes
If you just dress in white.

Nobody knows
How cold it blows
And nobody sees
How shaky my knees
Nobody cares
How steep my stairs
And nobody smiles
If you cross their stiles.

Oh poor boy
So sorry for himself
Oh poor boy
So worried for his health.
You may say every day
Where will he stay tonight.

Oh poor boy
So worried for his life
Oh poor boy
So keen to take a wife.

So sorry for himself

Is part of a chain

Now take a little while to make your story clear.

Get on your knees
Pray for warmth and green paper.
A city drought

You're down and out
See your trousers don't taper.
Saddle up
Kick your feet

Ride the range of a London street
Travel to a local plane
Turn around and come back again.

And at the chime of the city clock
Put up your road block
Hang on to your crown.
For a stone in a tin can
Is wealth to the city man
Who leaves his armor down.

Stay indoors
Beneath the floors
Talk with neighbors only.
The games you play

Make people say
You're either weird or lonely.
A city star
Won't shine too far

On account of the way you are
And the beads
Around your face
Make you sure to fit back in place.

And at the beat of the city drum
See how your friends come in twos;
Or threes or more.
For the sound of a busy place

Is fine for a pretty face
Who knows what a face is for.

The city clown
Will soon fall down
Without a face to hide in.
And he will lose

If he won't choose
The one he may confide in.
Sonny boy
With smokes for sale

Went to ground with a face so pale
And never heard
About the change
Showed his hand and fell out of range.

In the light of a city square
Find out the face that's fair
Keep it by your side.
When the light of the city falls
You fly to the city walls
Take off with your bride.

A sign of the times today
And hearing no bell from a steeple tall
People all in dismay
Falling so far on a silver spoon
Making the moon for fun
And changing a rope for a size too small
People all get hung.

So far away, so long ago it seems
The memory comes of a distant beach
Pale sand stretching far from reach

I looked behind, I saw this one so sweet
She came to me and I saw in her eyes
The heavy toll of a thousand eyes
I called her my princess of the sand

She stared at me and my mind was in a maze
As we moved along in a summer sea-dream haze
She moved her mouth but there came no sound
The message she brought can never be found
But I called her my princess of the sand

One moment we walked with the night breeze in our face
Then I looked, she'd gone of her presence, there was no trace
Where she went or came from who can know
Or if she'll ever return to help me know
Who she is, my princess of the sand

I'll go back to the sea, follow that sandy track
I'll look around, hope to find

And so secure amongst the books and all the records of your lifetime.

Now take a little while to make your story clear.

Get on your knees
Pray for warmth and green paper.
A city drought

You're down and out
See your trousers don't taper.
Saddle up
Kick your feet

Ride the range of a London street
Travel to a local plane
Turn around and come back again.

And at the chime of the city clock
Put up your road block
Hang on to your crown.
For a stone in a tin can
Is wealth to the city man
Who leaves his armor down.

Stay indoors
Beneath the floors
Talk with neighbors only.
The games you play

Make people say
You're either weird or lonely.
A city star
Won't shine too far

On account of the way you are
And the beads
Around your face
Make you sure to fit back in place.

And at the beat of the city drum
See how your friends come in twos;
Or threes or more.
For the sound of a busy place

Is fine for a pretty face
Who knows what a face is for.

The city clown
Will soon fall down
Without a face to hide in.
And he will lose

If he won't choose
The one he may confide in.
Sonny boy
With smokes for sale

Went to ground with a face so pale
And never heard
About the change
Showed his hand and fell out of range.

In the light of a city square
Find out the face that's fair
Keep it by your side.
When the light of the city falls
You fly to the city walls
Take off with your bride.

Of something that's past
Do you find things are moving

Do you hope to find new ways
Of quenching your thirst,
Do you hope to find new ways
Of doing better than your worst.

Slow, slow Jane, we're on the move.

Do it for you,
Sure that you would do the same for me one day.

Nobody spreads
Their aching heads.

And so secure amongst the books and all the records of your lifetime

Now take a little while to make your story clear

Weigh up your anchor

Pray for warmth and green paper
A city drought
You're down and out
See your trousers don't taper
Saddle up
Kick your feet
Ride the range of a London street
Travel to a local plane
Turn around and come back again

And at the chime of the city clock
Put up your road block
Hang on to your crown
For a stone in a tin can
Is wealth to the city man
Who leaves his armor down

Stay indoors
Beneath the floors
Talk with neighbors only
The games you play
Make people say
You're either weird or lonely
A city star
Won't shine too far
On account of the way you are
And the beads 
Around your face
Make you sure to fit back in place

And at the beat of the city drum
See how your friends come in twos
Or threes or more
For the sound of a busy place
Is fine for a pretty face
Who knows what a face is for

The city clown
Will soon fall down
Without a face to hide in
And he will lose
If he won't choose
The one he may confide in
Sonny boy
With smokes for sale
Went to ground with a face so pale
And never heard
About the change
Showed his hand and fell out of range

In the light of a city square
Find out the face that's fair
Keep it by your side
When the light of the city falls
You fly to the city walls
Take off with your bride

Get on your knees
Pray for warmth and green paper.
A city drought

You're down and out
See your trousers don't taper.
Saddle up
Kick your feet

Ride the range of a London street
Travel to a local plane
Turn around and come back again.

And at the chime of the city clock
Put up your road block
Hang on to your crown.
For a stone in a tin can
Is wealth to the city man
Who leaves his armor down.

Stay indoors
Beneath the floors
Talk with neighbors only.
The games you play

Make people say
You're either weird or lonely.
A city star
Won't shine too far

On account of the way you are
And the beads
Around your face
Make you sure to fit back in place.

And at the beat of the city drum
See how your friends come in twos;
Or threes or more.
For the sound of a busy place

Is fine for a pretty face
Who knows what a face is for.

The city clown
Will soon fall down
Without a face to hide in.
And he will lose

If he won't choose
The one he may confide in.
Sonny boy
With smokes for sale

Went to ground with a face so pale
And never heard
About the change
Showed his hand and fell out of range.

In the light of a city square
Find out the face that's fair
Keep it by your side.
When the light of the city falls
You fly to the city walls
Take off with your bride.

Of doing better than your worst.

The heavy toll of a thousand eyes

As we moved along in a summer sea-dream haze
She moved her mouth but there came no sound
The message she brought can never be found
But I called her my princess of the sand

Then I looked, she'd gone of her presence, there was no trace

Or if she'll ever return to help me know
Who she is, my princess of the sand

Is not so far from where you are

Never surprise.

And say a prayer for people there

Don't name the day or try to say
It happened before.

And see the sun when day is done

In autumn for free

Get on your knees
Pray for warmth and green paper.
A city drought

You're down and out
See your trousers don't taper.
Saddle up
Kick your feet

Ride the range of a London street
Travel to a local plane
Turn around and come back again.

And at the chime of the city clock
Put up your road block
Hang on to your crown.
For a stone in a tin can
Is wealth to the city man
Who leaves his armor down.

Stay indoors
Beneath the floors
Talk with neighbors only.
The games you play

Make people say
You're either weird or lonely.
A city star
Won't shine too far

On account of the way you are
And the beads
Around your face
Make you sure to fit back in place.

And at the beat of the city drum
See how your friends come in twos;
Or threes or more.
For the sound of a busy place

Is fine for a pretty face
Who knows what a face is for.

The city clown
Will soon fall down
Without a face to hide in.
And he will lose

If he won't choose
The one he may confide in.
Sonny boy
With smokes for sale

Went to ground with a face so pale
And never heard
About the change
Showed his hand and fell out of range.

In the light of a city square
Find out the face that's fair
Keep it by your side.
When the light of the city falls
You fly to the city walls
Take off with your bride.

But at the chime of a city clock
Put up your road block
Hang on to your crown.

Seems that I've forgotten
Never ask what I came for
Or how I was begotten.

And I'm a ranger
Things I say
May seem stranger than Sunday
Changing to Monday.
Nobody knows
How cold it flows
And nobody feels
The worn down heels
Nobody's eyes
Make the skies
Nobody spreads
Their aching heads.

Oh poor boy
So worried for his life
Oh poor boy
So keen to take a wife.

He's a mess but he'll say yes
If you just dress in white.

Nobody knows
How cold it blows
And nobody sees
How shaky my knees
Nobody cares
How steep my stairs
And nobody smiles

So crowded that you can't look out the window in the morning.

What will happen in the evening in the forest with the weasel
With the teeth that bite so sharp when you're not looking in the evening.

And all the friends that you once knew are left behind they kept you safe
And so secure amongst the books and all the records of your lifetime.

What will happen
In the morning
When the world it gets so crowded that you can't look out the window
In the morning.

Hey, take a little while to grow your brother's hair
And now, take a little while to make your sister fair.
And now that the family
Is part of a chain
Take off your eye shade
Start over again.

Now take a little while to find your way in here
Now take a little while to make your story clear.
Now that you're lifting
Your feet from the ground
Weigh up your anchor
And never look round.

Get on your knees
Pray for warmth and green paper.
A city drought

You're down and out
See your trousers don't taper.
Saddle up
Kick your feet

Ride the range of a London street
Travel to a local plane
Turn around and come back again.

And at the chime of the city clock
Put up your road block
Hang on to your crown.
For a stone in a tin can
Is wealth to the city man
Who leaves his armor down.

Stay indoors
Beneath the floors
Talk with neighbors only.
The games you play

Make people say
You're either weird or lonely.
A city star
Won't shine too far

On account of the way you are
And the beads
Around your face
Make you sure to fit back in place.

And at the beat of the city drum
See how your friends come in twos;
Or threes or more.
For the sound of a busy place

Is fine for a pretty face
Who knows what a face is for.

The city clown
Will soon fall down
Without a face to hide in.
And he will lose

If he won't choose
The one he may confide in.
Sonny boy
With smokes for sale

Went to ground with a face so pale
And never heard
About the change
Showed his hand and fell out of range.

In the light of a city square
Find out the face that's fair
Keep it by your side.
When the light of the city falls
You fly to the city walls
Take off with your bride.

But at the chime of a city clock
Put up your road block
Hang on to your crown.

A sign of the times today
And hearing no bell from a steeple tall

Falling so far on a silver spoon
Making the moon for fun

Get on your knees
Pray for warmth and green paper.
A city drought

You're down and out
See your trousers don't taper.
Saddle up
Kick your feet

Ride the range of a London street
Travel to a local plane
Turn around and come back again.

And at the chime of the city clock
Put up your road block
Hang on to your crown.
For a stone in a tin can
Is wealth to the city man
Who leaves his armor down.

Stay indoors
Beneath the floors
Talk with neighbors only.
The games you play

Make people say
You're either weird or lonely.
A city star
Won't shine too far

On account of the way you are
And the beads
Around your face
Make you sure to fit back in place.

And at the beat of the city drum
See how your friends come in twos;
Or threes or more.
For the sound of a busy place

Is fine for a pretty face
Who knows what a face is for.

The city clown
Will soon fall down
Without a face to hide in.
And he will lose

If he won't choose
The one he may confide in.
Sonny boy
With smokes for sale

Went to ground with a face so pale
And never heard
About the change
Showed his hand and fell out of range.

In the light of a city square
Find out the face that's fair
Keep it by your side.
When the light of the city falls
You fly to the city walls
Take off with your bride.

But at the chime of a city clock
Put up your road block
Hang on to your crown.

And so secure amongst the books and all the records of your lifetime

Aint nothing go right with me
Must be Ive been smoking too long.

Well I go to find me some breakfast
But I aint got no food
Take me a shower
But the water dont feel no good.

Tell me

Ive got opium in my chimney
No other life to choose
Nightmare made of hash dreams.
Got the devil in my shoes

Tell me

Well when Im smoking
Put my worries on a shelf
Dont think about nothin
Try not to see myself.

Tell me

Well in this blues Im singin
Theres a lesson to be learned

The thoughts of Mary jane
Why she flies
Or goes out in the rain
Where she's been
And who she's seen
In her journey to the stars.

Who can know
The reasons for her smile
What are her dreams
When they've journeyed for a mile
The way she sings
And her brightly coloured rings
Make her the princess of the sky.

Who can know
What happens in her mind
Did she come from a strange world
And leave her mind behind
Her long lost sighs
And her brightly coloured eyes
Tell her story to the wind.

Se murió mi amigo bronco
Se fue a ver que hay más allá
Siempre fue el caballo más atrevido
Bronco a más 

Se rompieron sus tobillos
Yo lo tuve que acabar
Mientras le decía despacito
Nos vamos a encontrar

Pa' volver a hacer camino
Pa' correr hasta volar
Se me fue mi amigo a hacerme un sitio 
En el más allá

Se fue
Caballo loco que jamás dio un paso al tren 
(Dio un paso al tren)
Pero tenía que perder alguna vez
Tuvo patas de oro y de papel

Se fue

Pero renace en un potrillo que se ve
Negro fuerte y bronco como él

There is no hello and no goodbye

They would keep their dreams till another day
