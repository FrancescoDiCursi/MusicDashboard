Throw them over my shoulder

Oh poor boy
So worried for his health.

Where will he stay tonight.

Seems that I've forgotten
Never ask what I came for
Or how I was begotten.

And I'm a ranger
Things I say
May seem stranger than Sunday
Changing to Monday.
Nobody knows
How cold it flows
And nobody feels
The worn down heels
Nobody's eyes
Make the skies
Nobody spreads
Their aching heads.

So worried for his life
Oh poor boy
So keen to take a wife.

He's a mess but he'll say yes
If you just dress in white.

Who leaves his armor down.

Stay indoors
Beneath the floors
Talk with neighbors only.

Make people say
You're either weird or lonely.

Won't shine too far

On account of the way you are
And the beads
Around your face
Make you sure to fit back in place.

And at the beat of the city drum
See how your friends come in twos;
Or threes or more.
For the sound of a busy place

Is fine for a pretty face
Who knows what a face is for.

Will soon fall down
Without a face to hide in.
And he will lose

If he won't choose
The one he may confide in.

With smokes for sale

Went to ground with a face so pale
And never heard
About the change
Showed his hand and fell out of range.

Find out the face that's fair
Keep it by your side.

Take off with your bride.

Pale sand stretching far from reach

I looked behind, I saw this one so sweet
She came to me and I saw in her eyes
The heavy toll of a thousand eyes
I called her my princess of the sand

She stared at me and my mind was in a maze
As we moved along in a summer sea-dream haze
She moved her mouth but there came no sound
The message she brought can never be found
But I called her my princess of the sand

One moment we walked with the night breeze in our face
Then I looked, she'd gone of her presence, there was no trace
Where she went or came from who can know
Or if she'll ever return to help me know
Who she is, my princess of the sand

I'll go back to the sea, follow that sandy track
I'll look around, hope to find

So she may laugh in the autumn of your years
When you're with her you'll wonder if it's true
All that they said of a world without you

Where she may come from, where she may go
Who she may run from, no one will know
Why she was late may trouble you some
Still you wait for Joey to come

Joey will come when once more it looks like snow
Joey will come when it's really time to go
And you may smile when you find that you've been wrong
You thought you found her but she knew you all along
But Joey will come to say hello, Joey",0.0,0.0,0.205

Will soon fall down
Without a face to hide in.
And he will lose

If he won't choose
The one he may confide in.

Sure that you would do the same for me one day.

Now Im late for work.

Tell me, tell me
What have I done wrong?
Aint nothing go right with me
Must be Ive been smoking too long.

Well I go to find me some breakfast
But I aint got no food
Take me a shower
But the water dont feel no good.

Tell me

Ive got opium in my chimney
No other life to choose
Nightmare made of hash dreams.
Got the devil in my shoes

Tell me

Well when Im smoking
Put my worries on a shelf
Dont think about nothin
Try not to see myself.

Tell me

Well in this blues Im singin
Theres a lesson to be learned
Dont go around smokin

The memory comes of a distant beach
Pale sand stretching far from reach
It was then I found my princess of the sand

As I traced the foam, pebbles beneath my feet
I looked behind, I saw this one so sweet
She came to me and I saw in her eyes
The heavy toll of a thousand eyes
I called her my princess of the sand

She stared at me and my mind was in a maze
As we moved along in a summer sea-dream haze
She moved her mouth but there came no sound
The message she brought can never be found
But I called her my princess of the sand

One moment we walked with the night breeze in our face
Then I looked, she'd gone of her presence, there was no trace
Where she went or came from who can know
Or if she'll ever return to help me know
Who she is, my princess of the sand

Sometime when the summer nights come back
I'll go back to the sea, follow that sandy track
I'll look around, hope to find
That strange young dream, close behind

See your trousers don't taper.

Kick your feet

Ride the range of a London street
Travel to a local plane
Turn around and come back again.

And at the chime of the city clock
Put up your road block
Hang on to your crown.
For a stone in a tin can
Is wealth to the city man
Who leaves his armor down.

Stay indoors
Beneath the floors
Talk with neighbors only.
The games you play

Make people say
You're either weird or lonely.
A city star
Won't shine too far

On account of the way you are
And the beads
Around your face
Make you sure to fit back in place.

And at the beat of the city drum
See how your friends come in twos;
Or threes or more.
For the sound of a busy place

Is fine for a pretty face
Who knows what a face is for.

The city clown
Will soon fall down
Without a face to hide in.
And he will lose

If he won't choose
The one he may confide in.
Sonny boy
With smokes for sale

Went to ground with a face so pale
And never heard
About the change
Showed his hand and fell out of range.

In the light of a city square
Find out the face that's fair
Keep it by your side.
When the light of the city falls
You fly to the city walls
Take off with your bride.

But at the chime of a city clock
Put up your road block
Hang on to your crown.

If I cross their stiles.

Oh poor boy
So sorry for himself
Oh poor boy
So worried for his health.
You may say every day
Where will he stay tonight.

Never know what I came for
Seems that I've forgotten
Never ask what I came for
Or how I was begotten.

I'm a poor boy
And I'm a ranger
Things I say
May seem stranger than Sunday
Changing to Monday.
Nobody knows
How cold it flows
And nobody feels
The worn down heels
Nobody's eyes
Make the skies
Nobody spreads
Their aching heads.

Oh poor boy
So worried for his life
Oh poor boy
So keen to take a wife.

He's a mess but he'll say yes
If you just dress in white.

Nobody knows 
How cold it blows
And nobody sees
How shaky my knees
Nobody cares
How steep my stairs
And nobody smiles
If you cross their stiles.

Oh poor boy
So sorry for himself
Oh poor boy
So worried for his health.
You may say every day
Where will he stay tonight.

Oh poor boy

Whenever he saw her he could only simply sigh
But she lived in a house so very big and grand
For him it seemed like some very distant land
So when he called her
His shed to mend,
She said I'm sorry you'll just have to find a friend.

Or how I was begotten.

I'm a poor boy
And I'm a ranger
Things I say
May seem stranger than Sunday
Changing to Monday.
Nobody knows
How cold it flows
And nobody feels
The worn down heels
Nobody's eyes
Make the skies
Nobody spreads
Their aching heads.

Oh poor boy
So worried for his life
Oh poor boy
So keen to take a wife.

He's a mess but he'll say yes
If you just dress in white.

Nobody knows 
How cold it blows
And nobody sees
How shaky my knees
Nobody cares
How steep my stairs
And nobody smiles
If you cross their stiles.

Oh poor boy
So sorry for himself
Oh poor boy
So worried for his health.
You may say every day
Where will he stay tonight.

Oh poor boy
So worried for his life
Oh poor boy
So keen to take a wife.

And so secure amongst the books and all the records of your lifetime.

Now take a little while to make your story clear.

Going to see the river man
Going to tell him all I can
About the plan
For lilac time.

If he tells me all he knows
About the way his river flows
And all night shows
In summertime.

Betty said she prayed today
For the sky to blow away
Or maybe stay
She wasn't sure.

For when she thought of summer rain
Calling for her mind again
She lost the pain
And stayed for more.

Going to see the river man
Going to tell him all I can
About the ban
On feeling free.

If he tells me all he knows
About the way his river flows

It's meant for me.

Taking his woes
Down to the sea
In search of a lifetime
To tell when he's home
In search of a story
That's never been known

Three hours from speaking
Everyone's flown
Not wanting to be
Seen on their own
Three hours is needed
To leave from them all
Three hours to wonder
And three hours to fall

Three hours from sundown
Jeremy flies
Hoping to keep the sun from his eyes
East from the city
And down to the cave
In search of a master
In search of a slave",0.0,0.0,0.10666666666666666

About things today
And fallen leaves.

Said she hadn't heard the news
Hadn't had the time to choose
A way to lose

Going to tell him all I can
About the plan
For lilac time.

If he tells me all he knows
About the way his river flows
And all night shows
In summertime.

Betty said she prayed today
For the sky to blow away
Or maybe stay
She wasn't sure.

For when she thought of summer rain
Calling for her mind again
She lost the pain
And stayed for more.

Going to tell him all I can

On feeling free.

Get on your knees
Pray for warmth and green paper.
A city drought

You're down and out
See your trousers don't taper.
Saddle up
Kick your feet

Ride the range of a London street
Travel to a local plane
Turn around and come back again.

And at the chime of the city clock
Put up your road block
Hang on to your crown.
For a stone in a tin can
Is wealth to the city man
Who leaves his armor down.

Stay indoors
Beneath the floors
Talk with neighbors only.
The games you play

Make people say
You're either weird or lonely.
A city star
Won't shine too far

On account of the way you are
And the beads
Around your face
Make you sure to fit back in place.

And at the beat of the city drum
See how your friends come in twos;
Or threes or more.
For the sound of a busy place

Is fine for a pretty face
Who knows what a face is for.

The city clown
Will soon fall down
Without a face to hide in.
And he will lose

If he won't choose
The one he may confide in.
Sonny boy
With smokes for sale

Went to ground with a face so pale
And never heard
About the change
Showed his hand and fell out of range.

In the light of a city square
Find out the face that's fair
Keep it by your side.
When the light of the city falls
You fly to the city walls
Take off with your bride.

But at the chime of a city clock
Put up your road block
Hang on to your crown.
For a stone in a tin can

Is wealth to the city man
Who leaves his armor down.",0.0,0.0,0.1389351851851852

As we moved along in a summer sea-dream haze
She moved her mouth but there came no sound
The message she brought can never be found
But I called her my princess of the sand

One moment we walked with the night breeze in our face
Then I looked, she'd gone of her presence, there was no trace
Where she went or came from who can know
Or if she'll ever return to help me know
Who she is, my princess of the sand

For the sky to blow away

Calling for her mind again
She lost the pain

Make people say

Won't shine too far

On account of the way you are
And the beads
Around your face
Make you sure to fit back in place.

And at the beat of the city drum
See how your friends come in twos;
Or threes or more.
For the sound of a busy place

Is fine for a pretty face
Who knows what a face is for.

The city clown
Will soon fall down
Without a face to hide in.
And he will lose

If he won't choose
The one he may confide in.
Sonny boy
With smokes for sale

Went to ground with a face so pale
And never heard
About the change
Showed his hand and fell out of range.

Find out the face that's fair
Keep it by your side.
When the light of the city falls
You fly to the city walls
Take off with your bride.

Pale sand stretching far from reach

I looked behind, I saw this one so sweet
She came to me and I saw in her eyes
The heavy toll of a thousand eyes
I called her my princess of the sand

She stared at me and my mind was in a maze
As we moved along in a summer sea-dream haze
She moved her mouth but there came no sound
The message she brought can never be found
But I called her my princess of the sand

One moment we walked with the night breeze in our face
Then I looked, she'd gone of her presence, there was no trace
Where she went or came from who can know
Or if she'll ever return to help me know
Who she is, my princess of the sand

I'll go back to the sea, follow that sandy track
I'll look around, hope to find
That strange young dream, close behind

Go out to fight
But while the earth sinks to its grave
You sail to the sky
On the crest of a wave

What will happen in the evening in the forest with the weasel
With the teeth that bite so sharp when you're not looking in the evening.

And all the friends that you once knew are left behind they kept you safe
And so secure amongst the books and all the records of your lifetime.

What will happen
In the morning
When the world it gets so crowded that you can't look out the window
In the morning.

Hey, take a little while to grow your brother's hair
And now, take a little while to make your sister fair.
And now that the family
Is part of a chain
Take off your eye shade
Start over again.

Now take a little while to find your way in here
Now take a little while to make your story clear.
Now that you're lifting
Your feet from the ground
Weigh up your anchor
And never look round.

Let's sing a song 
For Hazey Jane
She's back again in my mind.

In a conversation
The situation would be fine",0.6,0.0,0.04583333333333333

Get on your knees
Pray for warmth and green paper.
A city drought

You're down and out
See your trousers don't taper.
Saddle up
Kick your feet

Ride the range of a London street
Travel to a local plane
Turn around and come back again.

And at the chime of the city clock
Put up your road block
Hang on to your crown.
For a stone in a tin can
Is wealth to the city man
Who leaves his armor down.

Stay indoors
Beneath the floors
Talk with neighbors only.
The games you play

Make people say
You're either weird or lonely.
A city star
Won't shine too far

On account of the way you are
And the beads
Around your face
Make you sure to fit back in place.

And at the beat of the city drum
See how your friends come in twos;
Or threes or more.
For the sound of a busy place

Is fine for a pretty face
Who knows what a face is for.

The city clown
Will soon fall down
Without a face to hide in.
And he will lose

If he won't choose
The one he may confide in.
Sonny boy
With smokes for sale

Went to ground with a face so pale
And never heard
About the change
Showed his hand and fell out of range.

In the light of a city square
Find out the face that's fair
Keep it by your side.
When the light of the city falls
You fly to the city walls
Take off with your bride.

But at the chime of a city clock
Put up your road block
Hang on to your crown.

See your trousers don't taper.

Kick your feet

Ride the range of a London street
Travel to a local plane
Turn around and come back again.

And at the chime of the city clock
Put up your road block
Hang on to your crown.
For a stone in a tin can
Is wealth to the city man
Who leaves his armor down.

Stay indoors
Beneath the floors
Talk with neighbors only.
The games you play

Make people say
You're either weird or lonely.
A city star
Won't shine too far

On account of the way you are
And the beads
Around your face
Make you sure to fit back in place.

And at the beat of the city drum
See how your friends come in twos;
Or threes or more.
For the sound of a busy place

Is fine for a pretty face
Who knows what a face is for.

The city clown
Will soon fall down
Without a face to hide in.
And he will lose

If he won't choose
The one he may confide in.
Sonny boy
With smokes for sale

Went to ground with a face so pale
And never heard
About the change
Showed his hand and fell out of range.

In the light of a city square
Find out the face that's fair
Keep it by your side.
When the light of the city falls
You fly to the city walls
Take off with your bride.

But at the chime of a city clock
Put up your road block
Hang on to your crown.

So pale and sincere
Underneath you know well
You have nothing to fear
For the dreams that came to you when so young
Told of a life
Where spring is sprung

You would seem so frail
In the cold of the night
When the armies of emotion
Go out to fight
But while the earth sinks to its grave
You sail to the sky
On the crest of a wave

So forget this cruel world
Where I belong
I'll just sit and wait
And sing my song
And if one day you should see me in the crowd
Lend a hand and lift me
To your place in the cloud",0.0,0.0,-0.19428571428571426

You're a rare, rare find
A troubled cure
For a troubled mind.

And time has told me
Not to ask for more
Someday our ocean
Will find its shore.

So I'll leave the ways that are making me be
What I really don't want to be
Leave the ways that are making me love
What I really don't want to love.

Time has told me
You came with the dawn
A soul with no footprint
A rose with no thorn.

Your tears they tell me
There's really no way
Of ending your troubles
With things you can say

And time will tell you
To stay by my side
To keep on trying
'Til there's no more to hide

So leave the ways that are making you be
What you really don't want to be
Leave the ways that are making you love
What you really don't want to love.

Aint nothing go right with me
Must be Ive been smoking too long.

Well I go to find me some breakfast
But I aint got no food
Take me a shower
But the water dont feel no good.

Tell me

Ive got opium in my chimney
No other life to choose
Nightmare made of hash dreams.
Got the devil in my shoes

Tell me

Well when Im smoking
Put my worries on a shelf
Dont think about nothin
Try not to see myself.

Tell me

Well in this blues Im singin
Theres a lesson to be learned
Dont go around smokin
Unless you want to get burned.

When they've journeyed for a mile
The way she sings
And her brightly coloured rings
Make her the princess of the sky.

Did she come from a strange world
And leave her mind behind
Her long lost sighs
And her brightly coloured eyes
Tell her story to the wind.

Success can be gained
But at too great a cost
