Escaping from my wedding day
I heard the bells ringing in the local church

Telegrams came and the cheap champagne 
Was driving everybody out of their brains
But I convinced my best friends I lost my nerve 
And I pleaded I was being framed

""Sailor show me which way to go"" 
I screamed out loud
""Sailor show me which way to go""

Such a deadly silence 
Due to my defiance 
The wedding ground to a halt
Said I changed my mind
Ain't no use in your trying
So her brother punched me in the throat
Her mother got hysterical
The bitch was cynical 
Father's in the corner drunk
Picking myself off the floor 
I ran to the door
Damned if I was skippin' on my way

Said ""Sailor show me which way to go""

Tearing down the highway in the pouring rain
Escaping from my wedding day
I heard the bells ringing in the local church 
The ceremony's nearly under way
Telegrams came and the cheap champagne 
Was driving everybody out of their brains
But I convinced my best friends I lost my nerve 
And I pleaded I was being framed

""Sailor show me which way to go"" 
I screamed out loud
""Sailor show me which way to go""

Such a deadly silence 
Due to my defiance 
The wedding ground to a halt
Said I changed my mind
Ain't no use in your trying
So her brother punched me in the throat
Her mother got hysterical
The bitch was cynical 
Father's in the corner drunk
Picking myself off the floor 
I ran to the door
Damned if I was skippin' on my way

""Sailor show me which way to go""
You should have heard the noise
Said ""Sailor show me which way to go""

So keep clean girlie 
Find a man that's truly 
Gonna love you from dusk till dawn
Keep your front door key 
Don't give him up for me 
'Cause tomorrow I may be gone
You see, your wouldbe keepers
All night creepin'
Nobody gonna change in there
Who thinks a marriage life should be like a dog's life
So let's renew it when the year runs out

Have things changed at all?
Are we still a bunch of slaves?
Cradle to the grave we are
Free souls trapped inside a cage
Programmed for their system
To die inside a prison
But until there is no air to breathe
And we cannot dare to dream
Our last nightmare, lonely screams
The spirit in the abyss

What've done to him? What've done to him?

The spirit in the abyss what becomes of it?
What becomes of it?

Escape the sinking ship
The institutions that you know and trust
All turned out to be a bluff

Tie the rope around my neck
The souls are trapped inside our flesh

I don't care what the law might do
I hope your folks are good to you

And took his daughter for good luck

I spent all my doe on a gun
Liquored up to have some fun

I drink all night, and i feel real fine
As I'm roaring past that old state line

Driving up all night and day
Just to show him on his way (Here it comes)

I'm bailing down the streets of town
I'd love to burn the fucker down

Down the road, along the way
I drove right past my brother, hey

I'm running up the lawn each night
And they can't see me, there's no light

Kick down the door, then I say
'Brace yourself for judgement day'

Going back to Arkansas burying my ma and pa

And then I'm going far away
But where I'm going, I won't say

Cause I don't know, just where I'll run
I guess I follow the yellow sun

Or maybe north of Mexico
For I ain't saying where I'll go

I had to kill my mom and dad
Because they beat me up real bad

My daddy beat me everyday
And what I'd done, he wouldn't say

A leather strap across my back
And punched my eyes all blue and black

So, I killed my ma and pa
I killed them both in Arkansas

Made the papers so damn mad
Cause I killed my ma and dad

Has come but you don't care

That you were not aware
A glad chance still sit fair

In pieces you shall be
