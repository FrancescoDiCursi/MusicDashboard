Placed my hands upon the sky

Was following me around
With elevated senses

I slowly lose myself
Over and over

Take comfort in my skin
Endlessly
Surrender to my will
Forever and ever

I dissolve in trust
I will sing with joy
I will end up dust
I'm in heaven

I stand in golden rays
Radiantly
I burn a fire of love
Over and over

Reflecting endless light
Relentlessly
I have embraced the flame
Forever and ever

I will scream The Word
Jump into the void
I will guide the world

The angel of love was upon me
And Lord, I felt so weak
I felt my tongue move in my mouth
And I began to speak

A strange kind of language
I don’t understand
A babbling fountain
I couldn’t have planned

Oh leave me here forever more
I found the peace I’ve been searching for

The angel of love was upon me
And Lord, I felt so high
I swear I could have reached up
Placed my hands upon the sky

A radiant rainbow
Was following me around
With elevated senses
I can see and taste sound

The angel of love was upon me
And Lord, I felt so clean
Like a preacher on Sunday
My heart was serene

I waded into the water
I was bathed, I was drowned
Like the sinners before me
I knelt down on the ground

No mistaking the faking, I care
With a prayer in the air I will leave it there

Primed to do it's educating

Or shame upon the universe

Where holiness is never found

It may not last forever,

There's something magical in the air
Something so tragic we had to care

There's a strange obsession,
That's drawing us nearer
We don't understand it
It never gets clearer

There's something mystical in our dreams
So simplistic it kicks and screams

All we will seem to reek on the edge of collapse
Nothing can keep us down

There's a dizzying feeling,
That's keeping us flying
Some glittering gauntlet
Without even trying

There's something radical in our hands

With no conscience, repentance, oh no
Close your eyes, pay the price for your paradise

I can't conceal what I feel, what I know is real
No mistaking the faking, I care
With a prayer in the air I will leave it there

I just know that I'm harder to console
I don't see who I'm trying to be instead of me

Can you say what you're trying to play anyway
I just pay while you're breaking all the rules

Devils thrive on the drive that is fueled

All this running around, well it's getting me down
Just give me a pain that I'm used to
I don't need to believe all the dreams you conceive
You just need to achieve something that rings true

There's a hole in your soul like an animal
With no conscience, repentance unknown
Close your eyes, pay the price for your paradise
Devils feed on the seeds that are sown

I can't conceal what I feel, what I know is real
No mistaking the faking, I care
With a prayer in the air I will leave it there
On a note full of hope not despair

Visits me each night

Things between us must be worse but it's hard to see just how

And everything could have been perfect
Everything in the right place
Then I wouldn't have to play the suspect
Accused, abandoned and disgraced

I didn't choose, i didn't pull the trigger
It wasn't me, i'm just a plain and simple singer
I heard the sound, i turned my head around
To watch our love shot down

In another lonely universe, we're laying side by side
Well no-ones hurt and no-ones cursed and no one needs to hide

And everything is almost perfect
Everything is almost right

Accused, abandoned and disgraced

And give me support
And in return
She'll get my support
She will listen to me
When I want to speak
About the world we live in
And life in general
Though my views may be wrong
They may even be perverted
She'll hear me out
And won't easily be converted
To my way of thinking
In fact she'll often disagree
But at the end of it all
She will understand me

I want somebody who cares
For me passionately
With every thought and
With every breath
Someone who'll help me see things
In a different light
All the things I detest
I will almost like
I don't want to be tied
To anyone's strings
I'm carefully trying to steer clear of
Those things
But when I'm asleep
I want somebody
Who will put their arms around me
And kiss me tenderly
Though things like this
Make me sick
In a case like this
I'll get away with it",0.0,0.0,-0.00405352223534042

Slashed her wrists 
Bored with life
Didn't succeed

For small mercies

I expect to find Him laughing

Then came the rain
And once again
A tear fell
From her mother's eye

Been walking home a crooked mile

But careful what you're giving

Pain is ready, pain is waiting
Primed to do it's educating

Unwanted, uninvited kin
It creeps beneath your crawling skin
It lives without it lives within you

Feel the fever coming you're shaking and twitching
You can scratch all over
But that won't stop you itching

Can you feel a little love
Can you feel a little love
Dream on dream on

Blame it on your karmic curse
Or shame upon the universe
It knows its lines, it's well rehearsed

It sucked you in, it dragged you down
To where there is no hallow ground
Where holiness is never found

Unwanted, uninvited kin 
It creeps beneath your crawling skin 
It lives without, it lives within you 

Feel the fever coming 
You're shaking and twitching 
You can scratch all over 
But that won't stop you itching 

Can you feel a little love?
Can you feel a little love?

Dream on 
Dream on 

Blame it on your karmic curse 
Oh, shame upon the universe 
It knows its lines 
It's well rehearsed 

It sucked you in, it dragged you down 
To where there is no hallowed ground 
Where holiness is never found

Paying debt to karma
You party for a living
What you take won't kill you
But careful what you're giving

Can you feel a little love?
Can you feel a little love?

Dream on 
Dream on",1.0,0.0,0.037257936507936504

So does the pain

Things get damaged
Things get broken
I thought we'd manage
But words left unspoken
Left us so brittle
There was so little left to give

Shouldn't know suffering
I wish I could take the pain for you

That only He understands
I hope it's your eyes He's seeing through

As I'm closing on death
I will call out your name

I've been a martyr for love
Nailed up on the cross
While you're having your fun
As the damage is done
I'm assessing the cost

I knew what I was letting myself in for
I knew that I could never even the score

I've been a martyr for love
I need to be by your side
I have knelt at your feet
I have felt your deceit
Couldn't leave if I tried

I've been a martyr for love
Tortured every hour
From the day I was born
I've been moved like a pawn
By the greatest of powers

I knew that I would have to suffer in vain
Aware that I would never outgrow the pain

Break the silence
Come crashing in

Pierce right through me

All I ever needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm

To be broken
Feelings are intense
Words are trivial
Pleasures remain
So does the pain

And forgettable

Where heaven waits thre's golden gates
And back again
You take me to
And lead me through oblivion

It's just the dawning of our love

I feel you precious soul
And I am whole
I feel you, your rising sun
My kingdom comes

I feel you
Each move you make
I feel you
Each breath you take
Where angels sing spread their wings
My love's on high
You take me home to glory's throne

Heaven can you see what I see 

Hey you pale and sickly child 
You're death and living reconciled 
Been walking home a crooked mile 

Paying debt to karma 
You party for a living 
What you take won't kill you 
But careful what you're giving 

There's no time for hesitating 
Pain is ready, pain is waiting 
Primed to do it's educating 

Unwanted, uninvited kin 
It creeps beneath your crawling skin 
It lives without it lives within you 

Feel the fever coming 
You're shaking and twitching 
You can scratch all over 
But that won't stop you itching 

[Chorus]

Blame it on your karmic curse 
Oh shame upon the universe 
It knows its lines 
It's well rehearsed 

It sucked you in, it dragged you down 
To where there is no hallowed ground 
Where holiness is never found 

Paying debt to karma 
You party for a living 
What you take won't kill you 
But careful what you're giving

Couldn't leave if I tried

Tortured every hour
From the day I was born
I've been moved like a pawn

Aware that I would never outgrow the pain

As your bony fingers close around me
Long and spindly death becomes me
Heaven can you see what I see

Hey you pale and sickly child
You're death and living reconciled
Been walking home a crooked mile

Paying debt to karma you party for a living
What you take won't kill you
But careful what you're giving

There's no time for hesitating
Pain is ready, pain is waiting
Primed to do it's educating

Unwanted, uninvited kin
It creeps beneath your crawling skin
It lives without it lives within you

Feel the fever coming you're shaking and twitching
You can scratch all over
But that won't stop you itching

Can you feel a little love
Can you feel a little love
Dream on dream on

Blame it on your karmic curse
Or shame upon the universe
It knows its lines, it's well rehearsed

It sucked you in, it dragged you down
To where there is no hallow ground
Where holiness is never found

Paying debt to karma you party for a living
What you take won't kill you
But careful what you're giving

Can you feel a little love
Can you feel a little love
Dream on, dream on

Can you feel a little love
Can you feel a little love

On the policy of truth

It used to be so civilized
You will always wonder how
It could have been if you'd only lied

The scapegoat fate's made of me

Of letting go (do you know what I mean?)

Keep the same appointments i kept
If you try walking in my shoes
If you try walking in my shoes

Decency look down upon
The scapegoat fate's made of me
But i promise now, my judge and jurors
My intentions couldn't have been purer
My case is easy to see

I'm not looking for a clearer conscience
Peace of mind after what I've been through
And before we talk of any repentance
Try walking in my shoes

I don't sympathize
For kindness, you substitute blindness
Please open your eyes

Condemnation, why?
Because my duty
Was always to beauty
That was my crime

Primed to do it's educating

To where there is no hallowed ground
Where holiness is never found

I don't sympathize.

And that was my crime

Been walking home a crooked mile

Paying debt to karma you party for a living
What you take won't kill you
But careful what you're giving

Pain is ready, pain is waiting
Primed to do it's educating

Unwanted, uninvited kin
It creeps beneath your crawling skin
It lives without it lives within you

Feel the fever coming you're shaking and twitching
You can scratch all over
But that won't stop you itching

Can you feel a little love
Can you feel a little love

Or shame upon the universe

Where holiness is never found

Like a baby in your arms

You make me smile when you care for me

Crumble to dust

Independence
Is still important for us though (we realize)
It's easy to make
The stupid mistake
Of letting go (do you know what I mean?)

You know each and every one (it frightens me)
But I need to drink more than you seem to think
Before I'm anyone's

That cling to the backs of my knees and my feet
Well I'm drowning in time to a desperate beat 
And I thank you for bringing me here
For showing me home
For singing these tears
Finally I've found that I belong 
Feels like home
I should have known
From my first breath 
God send the only true friend I call mine
Pretend that I'll make amends the next time
Befriend the glorious end of the line 
And I thank you for bringing me here
For showing me home
For singing these tears

For the wretched disciples
And the love that they swore
With their hearts on the Bible

To sit at your table
And feast on your holiness
As long as they're able

Needs it's sacrifices
They live for your beauty
And pay for their vices

My lonely soul brothers
But their spirit shall live on in
The hearts of all lovers

Your holding court
With your lips and your smile

Sure as Adam is Eve
Sure as Jonah turned Whaler
They're crooked love thieves
And you are their jailer

Needs it's sacrifices

Should have hidden it, shouldn't you
Now you're not satisfied
With what you're being put through 
It's just time to pay the price
For not listening to advice
And deciding in your youth
On the policy of truth 
Things could be so different now
It used to be so civilised
You will always wonder how
It could have been if you'd only lied 
It's too late to change events
It's time to face the consequence
For delivering the proof
In the policy of truth 
Never again
Is what you swore
The time before
Never again
Is what you swore
The time before 
Now you're standing there tongue tied
You'd better learn your lesson well
Hide what you have to hide
And tell what you have to tell
You'll see your problems multiplied
If you continually decide
To faithfully pursue
The policy of truth

I'll suffer with pride.

If for honestly you want apologies -
I don't sympathize.
If for kindness you substitute blindness -
Please open your eyes.

Condemnation, why.
Because my beauty was always to beauty -
And that was my crime

I laughed and climbed the rising cast

Found new life in Jesus Christ
Hit by a car 
Ended up

Then came the rain
And once again
A tear fell
From her mother's eye

I go out of my head
And I just can't get enough
And I just can't get enough
All the things you do to me
And everything you said
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough

We slip and slide as we fall in love
And I just can't seem to get enough of

We walk together
We're walking down the street
And I just can't get enough
And I just can't get enough
Every time I think of you
I know we have to meet
And I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough

It's getting hotter
It's a burning love
And I just can't seem to get enough of

I just can't seem to get enough

I just can't seem to get enough

And when it rains
You're shining down for me
And I just can't get enough
And I just can't get enough
Just like a rainbow
You know you set me free
And I just can't get enough
And I just can't get enough

You're like an angel
And you give me your love
And I just can't seem to get enough of

You think you only know me when you turn on the light
Now the room is lit, red danger
 
Complicating, circulating
New life, new life
Operating, generating
New life, new life
 
Transitions to another place
So the time will pass more slowly
Features fuse and your shadow's red
Like a film I've seen now show me
 
Your face is hidden and were out of sight
And the road just leads to nowhere
The stranger in the door is the same as before
So the question answers nowhere

I hand myself
Over on a plate
Now
Oh little girl
There are times when I feel
I rather not be
The one behind the wheel
Come
Pull my strings
Watch me move
I do anything
Please
Sweet little girl
I prefer
You behind the wheel
And me the passenger
Drive
I'm yours to keep
Do what you want
I'm going cheap

Aren't meant to confuse
Although they do
They're the ones that I would choose

Dangerous

Know I will come to harm

Aren't meant to deceive
They're not there

Should have hidden it, shouldn't you
Now you're not satisfied
With what you're being put through

It's just time to pay the price
For not listening to advice
And deciding in your youth
On the policy of truth

Things could be so different now
It used to be so civilised
You will always wonder how
It could have been if you'd only lied

It's too late to change events
It's time to face the consequence
For delivering the proof
In the policy of truth

Never again
Is what you swore
The time before
Never again
Is what you swore
The time before

Now you're standing there tongue tied
You'd better learn your lesson well
Hide what you have to hide
And tell what you have to tell

You'll see your problems multiplied
If you continually decide
To faithfully pursue
The policy of truth

Never again
Is what you swore
The time before
Never again
Is what you swore
The time before",0.0,-0.07142857142857142,-0.036111111111111094

Seen love mentioned many thousand times
But despite all the places I've looked
It's still no clearer, it's just not enough
I'm still no nearer the meaning of love

The meaning of love
The meaning of love

Noted down all my observations
Spent an evening watching television
Still I couldn't say with precision
Know it's a feeling and it comes from above
But what's the meaning, the meaning of love?

The meaning of love
Tell me the meaning of love

From the notes that I've made so far
Love seems something like wanting a scar
Well, I could be wrong, I'm just not sure you see
I've never been in love before, never been in love before
Never been in love before

Next I asked several friends of mine
If they could spare a few minutes of their time
Their look suggested that I'd lost my mind
Tell me the answer, my Lord high above
Tell me the meaning, the meaning of love

The meaning of love
Tell me the meaning of love
Tell me the meaning of love
Tell me the meaning of love

With my best friend
I hope he never lets me down again

Taking me where I want to be

We're flying high
We're watching the world pass us by
Never want to come down
Never want to put my feet back down
On the ground

I'm taking a ride
With my best friend
I hope he never lets me down again
Promises me I'm as safe as houses
As long as I remember who's wearing the trousers
I hope he never lets me down again

Never let me down
See the stars they're shining bright
Everything's alright tonight",-0.15555555555555559,-0.1134920634920635,0.24119047619047623

It's time to make amends
For all of the fun
The damage is done
And I feel diseased
I'm down on my knees
And I need forgiveness
Someone to bear witness
To the goodness within
Beneath the sin
Although I may flirt 
With all kinds of dirt
To the point of disease
Now I want release
From all this decay
Take it away
And somewhere
There's someone who cares
With a heart of gold

Slashed her wrists 
Bored with life
Didn't succeed

For small mercies

Sixteen candles burn in her mind
She takes the blame
It's always the same
She goes down on her knees

Fell in love with everything
Found new life in Jesus Christ
Hit by a car 
Ended up
On a life support machine

Birds were singing 
In the summer's sky
Then came the rain
And once again
A tear fell
From her mother's eye

What it is going to be like!

So we picked up our tools
And we warked in the morning light
With the last stone placed
Wasn't it a wonderful sight
But it fell back down
And scattered all around
Anything passes
When you need glosses!

My monument it fell down
My monument it fell down

Wark all of my days for this kind of praise
It fell down
Wark all of my days it fell down.",-0.4,0.0,0.07092013888888886

I'll never be the same again
Gonna lock myself in a cold black room
Gonna shadow myself in a veil of gloom

Each one pushed me nearer the edge
Gonna send my message through to you
And you'll receive the signal too

I will function, operate
I will be a satellite of hate

Disillusioned, I was disenchanted
Forgot the love that had been implanted
Heard the lies and I felt the cold
It broke my heart and I lost control

It's getting hotter
It's a burning love
And I just can't seem to get enough of

I just can't seem to get enough

And when it rains
You're shining down for me
And I just can't get enough
And I just can't get enough
Just like a rainbow
You know you set me free
And I just can't get enough
And I just can't get enough

I just know that I'm harder to console
I don't see who I'm trying to be instead of me
But the key is a question of control

Can you say what you're trying to play anyway
I just pay while you're breaking all the rules
All the signs that I find have been underlined
Devils thrive on the drive that is fueled

All this running around, well it's getting me down
Just give me a pain that I'm used to
I don't need to believe all the dreams you conceive
You just need to achieve something that rings true

There's a hole in your soul like an animal
With no conscience, repentance unknown
Close your eyes, pay the price for your paradise
Devils feed on the seeds that are sown

I can't conceal what I feel, what I know is real
No mistaking the faking, I care
With a prayer in the air I will leave it there
On a note full of hope not despair

All this running around, well it's getting me down

Things between us must be worse but it's hard to see just how

And everything could have been perfect
Everything in the right place

Accused, abandoned and disgraced

Forgiveness for the things I do

To anyone's strings

I want somebody
Who will put their arms around me 
And kiss me tenderly
Though things like this
Make me sick

As your bony fingers close around me
Long and spindly
Death becomes me
Heaven, can you see what I see?

Hey, you pale and sickly child
You're death and living reconciled
Been walking home a crooked mile

Paying debt to karma
You party for a living
What you take won't kill you
But careful what you're giving

There's no time for hesitating
Pain is ready, pain is waiting
Primed to do it's educating

Unwanted, uninvited kin
It creeps beneath your crawling skin
It lives without, it lives within you

Feel the fever coming
You're shaking and twitching
You can scratch all over
But that won't stop you itching

Can you feel a little love?
Can you feel a little love?

Dream on
Dream on

Blame it on your karmic curse
Oh, shame upon the universe
It knows its lines
It's well rehearsed

It sucked you in, it dragged you down
To where there is no hallowed ground
Where holiness is never found

Paying debt to karma
You party for a living
What you take won't kill you
But careful what you're giving

Can you feel a little love?
Can you feel a little love?

As I stood upon the back streets and we start to play
I was screaming louder as the curtains fall between us in a twisted way

Staring in the night
A picture in my room
And I think that she knew her lines

Break away tonight
I wanna hold your hand
We've got to get it right
We've got to understand

Placing all the questions in the minutes of a game we won so long ago
Dangerous and beautiful 
The radio transmission that I have to know

You could never run
You could never stay
And I think you belong to me

Give me something to get excited about
When everything is looking dull

Set me free
Set me free
Set me free
Fill me with desire, set me on fire

Don't think I'm impatient
Because I'm willing to wait
But something must happen
Before it gets too late
It could be my imagination
But wasn't there more than this numb sensation?

Set me free, remotivate me

A gauge of the deadliest trap ever laid

For singing these tears

That cling to the backs of my knees and my feet
Well I'm drowning in time to a desperate beat

I want somebody who cares for me passionately
With every thought and with every breath
Someone who'll help me see things in a different light
All the things I detest I will almost like
I don't want to be tied to anyone's strings
I'm carefully trying to steer clear of those things
But when I'm asleep I want somebody
Who will put their arms around me and kiss me tenderly
Though things like this make me sick
In a case like this, I'll get away with it

Put your head on my chest

For pleasure like this?

Did I have to lose control
To treasure your kiss?

Did I need to place my heart
In the palm of your hand

I'm not looking for a clearer conscience
Peace of mind after what I've been through
And before we talk of any repentance
Try walking in my shoes
Try walking in my shoes

You'll stumble in my footsteps
Keep the same appointments I kept
If you try walking in my shoes
If you try walking in my shoes
Try walking in my shoes

Now I'm not looking for absolution
Forgiveness for the things I do
But before you come to any conclusions
Try walking in my shoes

Keep the same appointments I kept

With hope as our faith, we look to the stars
Caroline's monkey is crying again
There's no satisfaction on Caroline's train

Caroline leaks through holes in her skin
Her promise of sweetness, forgiveness and everything
Caroline's monkey coos in her ear
Drives like a demon through Caroline's tears

Caroline feels the ice in her veins
The minutes and hours, the naming of days
Caroline said her dream never ends
For Caroline's monkey and Caroline's friends

Fading's better than failing
Falling's better than feeling
Folding's better than losing
Fixing's better than healing, sometimes

Caroline's monkey claws at her back
Colder than winter, darker than black
Caroline's monkey is hungry again
Running with scissors on needles and pins

Caroline's monkey lives where she lays
Sleeps like a thief and steals through the days
Caroline's monkey makes up all the fun
Leaves chaos and ruin on Caroline's tongue

Caroline knows how fragile we are
With hope as our faith, we look to the stars
Caroline's monkey is crying again
There's no satisfaction on Caroline's train

Fading's better than failing
Falling's better than feeling
Folding's better than losing
Fixing's better than healing, sometimes",0.0,-0.05,0.14492753623188404

With your words or wagging tongue
With your long tall tales of sorrow
Your song yet to be sung

I won't be offended
If I'm left across the great divide
Believe me, they will follow
Just to watch another angel die
Watch another angel die

You won't do well to darken me
With your secrets and your lies
With your piercing code of silence
Relax, enjoy the ride

I'll meet you by the river
Or maybe on the other side
You find it hard to swallow
When you watch another angel die
Watch another angel die

Another sun is rising
Another day has come
You can find me, I'll be waiting
Until the day is done

I won't be persuaded
Kiss your doubts goodbye
Everything seems hollow
When you watch another angel die

Watch another angel die
Watch another angel die
Watch another angel die
Watch another angel die
Watch another angel die",0.0,0.0,0.09047619047619046

That people are good
Whisper it under my breath
So I don't forget
Keep fooling myself
That they do all they can
Sometimes they simply slip up
But it's not what they meant (but it's not what they meant)

Heaven help me (help me, help me), heaven help me (help me, help me)
Heaven help us (help us, help us), heaven help us (help us, help us)

Keep reminding myself
That people are good
And when they do bad things
They're just hurting inside
Keep fooling myself
That everyone cares
And they're all full of love
It's just their patience gets tried

Heaven help me (help me, help me), heaven help me (help me, help me)
Heaven help us (help us, help us), heaven help us (help us, help us)

Everything will be alright in time
It will be fine

'Cause people are good

I'll be the corpse
You'll be the thriller
And I'll be the drama, of course

If you play the sinner
I'll play the stain
If you play the winner
I'll be your permanent pain

I'll be the boredom
You, the desire
I'll be the catcalls
And you'll be the sound of the choir

You, anesthetic
I'll be the scream
You'll be the promise
And I'll be the end of your dreams

So don't say you love me
'Cause you'll never love me

You'll be the flowers
That some lover sent
I'll be the goodbye note
That is hiding in them

You are the singer
I am the song
The tune that will linger
The bitter taste left on your tongue

So don't say you love me
How could you love me?

Your flowers and your make-believe
The secrets and the notes you keep
The promises left on the sheets
You'll never love me

Fool your friends, believe your lies
Make amends and alibis
In the end you can't disguise
That you'll never love me

You'll be the killer
I'll be the corpse
You'll be the laughter
And I'll be the punchline, of course",0.0,0.5,0.10500000000000001

Leaving my problems and the world's disasters
I'm heading for the open sky

I see the beauty as the leaves start falling
Follow the light towards the voices calling
I'm going where the angels fly

And I'm taking my soul with me
And I'm taking my soul with me

I'm ready for the final pages
Kiss goodbye to all my earthly cages
I'm climbing up the golden stairs

Go sing it from the highest tower
From the morning till the midnight hour
I'm going where there are no cares
