He can read your mind backwards

You can only be a loser
Paranoia never touch him
He's got ways of laughter
Baby don't you bring yourself down
Got to catch you up later

Waves that you ride
Just to bolster your pride
But if it's love that you're after
The craft of a hero
Will vibe at your side as alone you may glide
With a tiny afterthought
Flashing as the planet calls

through the moon and diving deep we'll meet the whale
Where rides the captain submarine
Who told the tale of pixies green
That sends us kisses in the brain
And out-far planets never seen
Except by technicolour dream

Moon burning slow motion
Waves that you ride
Just to bolster your pride
But if it's love that you're after
The craft of a hero
Will vibe at your side as alone you may glide
With a tiny afterthought
Flashing as the planet calls

through the moon and diving deep we'll meet the whale
Where rides the captain submarine
Who told the tale of pixies green
That sends us kisses in the brain
And out-far planets never seen

Through the inner space you ride

Okay, you're Mister Illusion
Smiling in all this confusion
'cause you're young today, tomorrow start to play
I'd just like to say

No I never
No I never ever ever glid before
I never - oh no

Last warning tide turning
Moon burning slow motion
Waves that you ride
Just to bolster your pride
But if it's love that you're after
The craft of a hero
Will vibe at your side as alone you may glide
With a tiny afterthought
Flashing as the planet calls

I never never glid before

Open up the veil and let us take a peep in
through the moon and diving deep we'll meet the whale
Where rides the captain submarine
Who told the tale of pixies green
That sends us kisses in the brain
And out-far planets never seen
Except by technicolour dream

I got a story to tell you
Of a band of little green men
From a far away planet
If you want to know about love
Then ask the wee geezer
He can teach you telepathy
He can read your mind backwards
If you try to do the cat in
You can only be a loser
Paranoia never touch him
He's got ways of laughter
Baby don't you bring yourself down
Got to catch you up later
If you want to know about love

Through the inner space you ride
Lots and lots of Pot-Head Pixies
Ridin' round in Teapot Taxies

If everything goes wrong today
Fill your Teapot up with tea
Come and take a ride with me
Down the oily way...

Scenes that we dreamed of
Time for the end of
Hate !
War !
Death !

Gotta choose to loose your games now

Now you're here and now you're Gong
But this ain't me that sings this song
For we the Gong Band it's enough
To be the instruments of love

On which the Octave Doctors play
That we be one and all as one with Gong
On earth and find again
The joys of going around the bend

Where are you ...
Doncha remember why you came to Everywhere...
The piece of mind that
You came to find has dis-appeared ...
For all that you could take
Was piece of cake and wine ...
And now you'll have to wait
Another time ...

Maybe you're here for the giggle
Maybe you're into the puzzle
Maybe you're blowing the bubble
Maybe you're all in a muddle

The more you know
The more you know you
Don't know what you know
Stone's throw left to go
Bad weather hell for leather
Now and zen you goof again
You never blow your trip forever

Earth mother soul brother
Be high here now
Third eye open soon
Meanwhile new world group soul
Lost and found underground
Next time round

A real weird number
Is Zero the man
Because he a turnin on
Round & round again
They say he'll never make it
But I think he can

There's a hole in the morning
It's the hole that he was born in
Now the old man's yawnin ...

It's the world of illusions
And Zero the Hero
Is up to his ears
In the mysteries ...
No solution to speak of ...
Round & round & round &
Round & round
That's Zero going round again ...
And maybe you come
And maybe you're gone
And maybe you're right
And maybe you're wrong
Maybe you're a one
And maybe you two
And maybe you're free
And dunno what for
Just as long as you're alive
It's all the same
It's all in the name
It's all in the sky and
It doesn't really matter
If you make it
So long as you try
So it's back on the path
Beside the road to everywhere
Gonna jump my horses
Over the weeks to everywhere
And with you we will share
Your sack of cares ...
And if things don't change for
Better or worse
Well man you must be dead
But cha don't have to give up hope
And ya don't have to give up dope (until you do)
And ya don't have to change your ways
You just
Have to
Be what you are my friends
Today ...
That's what the Octave Doctor says ...

So there goes Zero the Hero
Turning on around the wheel of births and deaths
And meanwhile the Octave Doctors
And the Pot Head Pixies and
All the other characters of
The Planet Gong hafta to leave you now
With a last little song

Why don't you...
Why don't you try...

Belong to him.
Singing O why... Singing O why...

He told me he would teach me everything I tried to know.
He made me see that you and me are dreamers in a show.
And when the days were darkest then he lit them with his moons.
And then we crossed the rainbow bridge but we came back...
Came back too soon...
Singing O why... Singing O why...

He showed me where he was Atman that man I could not see.
He pointed to the sky until a ladder I could see.
I climbed for many lives to find the secret golden flower.
And then I woke and found I'd slept for less than half...
Than half an hour.
Singing O why... Singing O why...

He brought us back together then when I was all alone.
He made me see I was not just of earth and skin and bone.

Where are you ...
Doncha remember why you came to Everywhere...
The piece of mind that
You came to find has dis-appeared ...
For all that you could take
Was piece of cake and wine ...
And now you'll have to wait
Another time ...

Maybe you're here for the giggle
Maybe you're into the puzzle
Maybe you're blowing the bubble
Maybe you're all in a muddle

The more you know
The more you know you
Don't know what you know
Stone's throw left to go
Bad weather hell for leather
Now and zen you goof again
You never blow your trip forever

Earth mother soul brother
Be high here now
Third eye open soon
Meanwhile new world group soul
Lost and found underground
Next time round

A real weird number
Is Zero the man
Because he a turnin on
Round & round again
They say he'll never make it
But I think he can

There's a hole in the morning
It's the hole that he was born in
Now the old man's yawnin ...

It's the world of illusions
And Zero the Hero
Is up to his ears
In the mysteries ...
No solution to speak of ...
Round & round & round &
Round & round
That's Zero going round again ...
And maybe you come
And maybe you're gone
And maybe you're right
And maybe you're wrong
Maybe you're a one
And maybe you two
And maybe you're free
And dunno what for
Just as long as you're alive
It's all the same
It's all in the name
It's all in the sky and
It doesn't really matter
If you make it
So long as you try
So it's back on the path
Beside the road to everywhere
Gonna jump my horses
Over the weeks to everywhere
And with you we will share
Your sack of cares ...
And if things don't change for
Better or worse
Well man you must be dead
But cha don't have to give up hope
And ya don't have to give up dope (until you do)
And ya don't have to change your ways
You just
Have to
Be what you are my friends
Today ...
That's what the Octave Doctor says ...

So there goes Zero the Hero
Turning on around the wheel of births and deaths
And meanwhile the Octave Doctors
And the Pot Head Pixies and
All the other characters of
The Planet Gong hafta to leave you now
With a last little song

Why don't you...
Why don't you try...

There went a man, he was a crazy mystic. 
And in the sky he saw a way, 
he heard a voice singin a song 
all about it. 
He saw the Path, it made him laugh... 
No ego fuss-so obvious-who could doubt it! 
He giggled & laughed all day... 
Wuz nothing that he could say... 
What more can I tell you? 

Bout the mad monk he don't shake no tit 
Just him & the One Love: That's IT! 
Mad monk he's a dancing soul 
Don't need no guru to take control 
Lafta yoga show me the way! 
Lafta yoga show me the way! 
Lafta yoga make me my day! 

Don't gimmee that olde time religion! 
No Lucifer no moral correction! 
No denomination, no confusion, no persuasion, 
No holy roller bogeyman no way! 
If you want direction, you better listen to 
the inner tuition, get on an inner mission! 
Whatcha doin' in the sin bin hey? 
Havin more fun than anyone ain'tcha? 
And you think you,re dabblin with danger don'tcha! 
But if ya listen to the mad monk 
You know what he,ll tell yoo? 
Whatever turns you on can be your teacher 
But only if you want it bad, you gotta be mad! 
You must have had a proper gutful of propaganda 
To under-overstand what the mad monk means 
When he hits you with the lafta yoga... 
You wanna know what lafta yoga is? 
Erhh herh herh ha ha ha hahhahhahhaa..whooh hooh hah 
Whooh hoo haah ha ha ha ha hah haaaa! 

Back in Mississippi, back in the bible belt... 
A mystic Walter Mitty, but one who was free of guilt!

Where are you ...
Doncha remember why you came to Everywhere...
The piece of mind that
You came to find has dis-appeared ...
For all that you could take
Was piece of cake and wine ...
And now you'll have to wait
Another time ...

Maybe you're here for the giggle
Maybe you're into the puzzle
Maybe you're blowing the bubble
Maybe you're all in a muddle

The more you know
The more you know you
Don't know what you know
Stone's throw left to go
Bad weather hell for leather
Now and zen you goof again
You never blow your trip forever

Earth mother soul brother
Be high here now
Third eye open soon
Meanwhile new world group soul
Lost and found underground
Next time round

A real weird number
Is Zero the man
Because he a turnin on
Round & round again
They say he'll never make it
But I think he can

There's a hole in the morning
It's the hole that he was born in
Now the old man's yawnin ...

It's the world of illusions
And Zero the Hero
Is up to his ears
In the mysteries ...
No solution to speak of ...
Round & round & round &
Round & round
That's Zero going round again ...
And maybe you come
And maybe you're gone
And maybe you're right
And maybe you're wrong
Maybe you're a one
And maybe you two
And maybe you're free
And dunno what for
Just as long as you're alive
It's all the same
It's all in the name
It's all in the sky and
It doesn't really matter
If you make it
So long as you try
So it's back on the path
Beside the road to everywhere
Gonna jump my horses
Over the weeks to everywhere
And with you we will share
Your sack of cares ...
And if things don't change for
Better or worse
Well man you must be dead
But cha don't have to give up hope
And ya don't have to give up dope (until you do)
And ya don't have to change your ways
You just
Have to
Be what you are my friends
Today ...
That's what the Octave Doctor says ...

So there goes Zero the Hero
Turning on around the wheel of births and deaths
And meanwhile the Octave Doctors
And the Pot Head Pixies and
All the other characters of
The Planet Gong hafta to leave you now
With a last little song

Why don't you...
Why don't you try...

You are I or I am you

yonder to see what's going on
But that's all right you'll soon be out

The moonwheel's turning, the waves unfulling you're
learning you're Zero at the centre of the whirlpool

Your aquaman and in your hand is a watering,
can I now or can I not believe it leave it to be
The fun gods winking and we're all blinking and
thinking we're sinking in the sea
You're in your glider the tide you're riding inside her
is turnin with the moony like the sky... boy

Okay, you're Mister Illusion
Smiling in all this confusion
'cause you're young today, tomorrow start to play
I'd just like to say

No I never
No I never ever ever glid before
I never - oh no

Last warning tide turning
Moon burning slow motion
Waves that you ride
Just to bolster your pride
But if it's love that you're after
The craft of a hero
Will vibe at your side as alone you may glide
With a tiny afterthought
Flashing as the planet calls

I never never glid before

Open up the veil and let us take a peep in
through the moon and diving deep we'll meet the whale
Where rides the captain submarine
Who told the tale of pixies green
That sends us kisses in the brain
And out-far planets never seen
Except by technicolour dream

I never never glid before

Then ask the wee geezer
He can teach you telepathy
He can read your mind backwards
If you try to do the cat in
You can only be a loser
Paranoia never touch him
He's got ways of laughter

Got to catch you up later

Okay, you're Mister Illusion
Smiling in all this confusion
'cause you're young today, tomorrow start to play
I'd just like to say

No I never
No I never ever ever glid before
I never - oh no

Last warning tide turning
Moon burning slow motion
Waves that you ride
Just to bolster your pride
But if it's love that you're after
The craft of a hero
Will vibe at your side as alone you may glide
With a tiny afterthought
Flashing as the planet calls

I never never glid before

Open up the veil and let us take a peep in
through the moon and diving deep we'll meet the whale
Where rides the captain submarine
Who told the tale of pixies green
That sends us kisses in the brain
And out-far planets never seen
Except by technicolour dream

Where are you ...
Doncha remember why you came to Everywhere...
The piece of mind that
You came to find has dis-appeared ...
For all that you could take
Was piece of cake and wine ...
And now you'll have to wait
Another time ...

Maybe you're here for the giggle
Maybe you're into the puzzle
Maybe you're blowing the bubble
Maybe you're all in a muddle

The more you know
The more you know you
Don't know what you know
Stone's throw left to go
Bad weather hell for leather
Now and zen you goof again
You never blow your trip forever

Earth mother soul brother
Be high here now
Third eye open soon
Meanwhile new world group soul
Lost and found underground
Next time round

A real weird number
Is Zero the man
Because he a turnin on
Round & round again
They say he'll never make it
But I think he can

There's a hole in the morning
It's the hole that he was born in
Now the old man's yawnin ...

It's the world of illusions
And Zero the Hero
Is up to his ears
In the mysteries ...
No solution to speak of ...
Round & round & round &
Round & round
That's Zero going round again ...
And maybe you come
And maybe you're gone
And maybe you're right
And maybe you're wrong
Maybe you're a one
And maybe you two
And maybe you're free
And dunno what for
Just as long as you're alive
It's all the same
It's all in the name
It's all in the sky and
It doesn't really matter
If you make it
So long as you try
So it's back on the path
Beside the road to everywhere
Gonna jump my horses
Over the weeks to everywhere
And with you we will share
Your sack of cares ...
And if things don't change for
Better or worse
Well man you must be dead
But cha don't have to give up hope
And ya don't have to give up dope (until you do)
And ya don't have to change your ways
You just
Have to
Be what you are my friends
Today ...
That's what the Octave Doctor says ...

So there goes Zero the Hero
Turning on around the wheel of births and deaths
And meanwhile the Octave Doctors
And the Pot Head Pixies and
All the other characters of
The Planet Gong hafta to leave you now
With a last little song

Why don't you...
Why don't you try...

I got a story to tell you
Of a band of little green men
From a far away planet
If you want to know about love
Then ask the wee geezer
He can teach you telepathy
He can read your mind backwards
If you try to do the cat in
You can only be a loser
Paranoia never touch him
He's got ways of laughter
Baby don't you bring yourself down
Got to catch you up later

Beside the road to everywhere
Gonna jump my horses
Over the weeks to everywhere
And with you we will share
Your sack of cares ...
And if things don't change for

Where are you ...
Doncha remember why you came to Everywhere...
The piece of mind that
You came to find has dis-appeared ...
For all that you could take
Was piece of cake and wine ...
And now you'll have to wait
Another time ...

Maybe you're here for the giggle
Maybe you're into the puzzle
Maybe you're blowing the bubble
Maybe you're all in a muddle

The more you know
The more you know you
Don't know what you know
Stone's throw left to go
Bad weather hell for leather
Now and zen you goof again
You never blow your trip forever

Earth mother soul brother
Be high here now
Third eye open soon
Meanwhile new world group soul
Lost and found underground
Next time round

A real weird number
Is Zero the man
Because he a turnin on
Round & round again
They say he'll never make it
But I think he can

There's a hole in the morning
It's the hole that he was born in
Now the old man's yawnin ...

It's the world of illusions
And Zero the Hero
Is up to his ears
In the mysteries ...
No solution to speak of ...
Round & round & round &
Round & round
That's Zero going round again ...
And maybe you come
And maybe you're gone
And maybe you're right
And maybe you're wrong
Maybe you're a one
And maybe you two
And maybe you're free
And dunno what for
Just as long as you're alive
It's all the same
It's all in the name
It's all in the sky and
It doesn't really matter
If you make it
So long as you try
So it's back on the path
Beside the road to everywhere
Gonna jump my horses
Over the weeks to everywhere
And with you we will share
Your sack of cares ...
And if things don't change for
Better or worse
Well man you must be dead
But cha don't have to give up hope
And ya don't have to give up dope (until you do)
And ya don't have to change your ways
You just
Have to
Be what you are my friends
Today ...
That's what the Octave Doctor says ...

So there goes Zero the Hero
Turning on around the wheel of births and deaths
And meanwhile the Octave Doctors
And the Pot Head Pixies and
All the other characters of
The Planet Gong hafta to leave you now
With a last little song

Why don't you...
Why don't you try...

Through the inner space you ride

Ridin' round in Teapot Taxies

Fill your Teapot up with tea
Come and take a ride with me

Time for the end of

Gotta choose to loose your games now

But this ain't me that sings this song
For we the Gong Band it's enough
To be the instruments of love

That we be one and all as one with Gong
On earth and find again
The joys of going around the bend

Through the inner space you ride
Lots and lots of Pot-Head Pixies
Ridin' round in Teapot Taxies

If everything goes wrong today
Fill your Teapot up with tea
Come and take a ride with me

Look !

High in the sky, the world you remember
Scenes that we dreamed of
Time for the end of
Hate !
War !
Death !

Gotta choose to loose your games now

Now you're here and now you're Gong
But this ain't me that sings this song
For we the Gong Band it's enough
To be the instruments of love

On which the Octave Doctors play
That we be one and all as one with Gong
On earth and find again
The joys of going around the bend

From a far away planet
If you want to know about love
Then ask the wee geezer
He can teach you telepathy
He can read your mind backwards
If you try to do the cat in
You can only be a loser
Paranoia never touch him
He's got ways of laughter
Baby don't you bring yourself down
Got to catch you up later

yonder to see what's going on

learning you're Zero at the centre of the whirlpool

thinking we're sinking in the sea

Okay, you're Mister Illusion
Smiling in all this confusion
'cause you're young today, tomorrow start to play
I'd just like to say

No I never
No I never ever ever glid before
I never - oh no

Last warning tide turning
Moon burning slow motion
Waves that you ride
Just to bolster your pride
But if it's love that you're after
The craft of a hero
Will vibe at your side as alone you may glide
With a tiny afterthought
Flashing as the planet calls

I never never glid before

Open up the veil and let us take a peep in
through the moon and diving deep we'll meet the whale
Where rides the captain submarine
Who told the tale of pixies green
That sends us kisses in the brain
And out-far planets never seen
Except by technicolour dream

Waves that you ride
Just to bolster your pride

The craft of a hero
Will vibe at your side as alone you may glide
With a tiny afterthought
Flashing as the planet calls

through the moon and diving deep we'll meet the whale
Where rides the captain submarine
Who told the tale of pixies green

Through the inner space you ride
