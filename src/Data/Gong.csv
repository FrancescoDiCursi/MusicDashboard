Where are you ...
Doncha remember why you came to Everywhere...
The piece of mind that
You came to find has dis-appeared ...
For all that you could take
Was piece of cake and wine ...
And now you'll have to wait
Another time ...

Maybe you're here for the giggle
Maybe you're into the puzzle
Maybe you're blowing the bubble
Maybe you're all in a muddle

The more you know
The more you know you
Don't know what you know
Stone's throw left to go
Bad weather hell for leather
Now and zen you goof again
You never blow your trip forever

Earth mother soul brother
Be high here now
Third eye open soon
Meanwhile new world group soul
Lost and found underground
Next time round

A real weird number
Is Zero the man
Because he a turnin on
Round & round again
They say he'll never make it
But I think he can

There's a hole in the morning
It's the hole that he was born in
Now the old man's yawnin ...

It's the world of illusions
And Zero the Hero
Is up to his ears
In the mysteries ...
No solution to speak of ...
Round & round & round &
Round & round
That's Zero going round again ...
And maybe you come
And maybe you're gone
And maybe you're right
And maybe you're wrong
Maybe you're a one
And maybe you two
And maybe you're free
And dunno what for
Just as long as you're alive
It's all the same
It's all in the name
It's all in the sky and
It doesn't really matter
If you make it
So long as you try
So it's back on the path
Beside the road to everywhere
Gonna jump my horses
Over the weeks to everywhere
And with you we will share
Your sack of cares ...
And if things don't change for
Better or worse
Well man you must be dead
But cha don't have to give up hope
And ya don't have to give up dope (until you do)
And ya don't have to change your ways
You just
Have to
Be what you are my friends
Today ...
That's what the Octave Doctor says ...

So there goes Zero the Hero
Turning on around the wheel of births and deaths
And meanwhile the Octave Doctors
And the Pot Head Pixies and
All the other characters of

To live love - live love, live love love

Where can we find our heart's desire

Belong to him.
Singing O why... Singing O why...

He told me he would teach me everything I tried to know.
He made me see that you and me are dreamers in a show.
And when the days were darkest then he lit them with his moons.
And then we crossed the rainbow bridge but we came back...
Came back too soon...
Singing O why... Singing O why...

He showed me where he was Atman that man I could not see.
He pointed to the sky until a ladder I could see.
I climbed for many lives to find the secret golden flower.
And then I woke and found I'd slept for less than half...
Than half an hour.
Singing O why... Singing O why...

He brought us back together then when I was all alone.

Down the Oily Way you slide
Through the inner space you ride
Lots and lots of Pot-Head Pixies
Ridin' round in Teapot Taxies

If everything goes wrong today
Fill your Teapot up with tea
Come and take a ride with me

Scenes that we dreamed of
Time for the end of
Hate !
War !
Death !

You big daddy in your big sick city
Gotta choose to loose your games now

Now you're here and now you're Gong
But this ain't me that sings this song
For we the Gong Band it's enough
To be the instruments of love

On which the Octave Doctors play
That we be one and all as one with Gong
On earth and find again
The joys of going around the bend

Was piece of cake and wine ...

Is Zero the man
Because he a turnin on
Round & round again

But I think he can

There's a hole in the morning
It's the hole that he was born in
Now the old man's yawnin ...

It's the world of illusions
And Zero the Hero
Is up to his ears

It's all the same
It's all in the name
It's all in the sky and
It doesn't really matter
If you make it
So long as you try
So it's back on the path
Beside the road to everywhere
Gonna jump my horses
Over the weeks to everywhere
And with you we will share
Your sack of cares ...
And if things don't change for
Better or worse

And ya don't have to give up dope (until you do)

There went a man, he was a crazy mystic. 
And in the sky he saw a way, 
he heard a voice singin a song 
all about it. 
He saw the Path, it made him laugh... 
No ego fuss-so obvious-who could doubt it! 
He giggled & laughed all day... 
Wuz nothing that he could say... 
What more can I tell you? 

Bout the mad monk he don't shake no tit 
Just him & the One Love: That's IT! 
Mad monk he's a dancing soul 
Don't need no guru to take control 
Lafta yoga show me the way! 
Lafta yoga show me the way! 
Lafta yoga make me my day! 

Don't gimmee that olde time religion! 
No Lucifer no moral correction! 
No denomination, no confusion, no persuasion, 
No holy roller bogeyman no way! 
If you want direction, you better listen to 
the inner tuition, get on an inner mission! 
Whatcha doin' in the sin bin hey? 
Havin more fun than anyone ain'tcha? 
And you think you,re dabblin with danger don'tcha! 
But if ya listen to the mad monk 
You know what he,ll tell yoo? 
Whatever turns you on can be your teacher 
But only if you want it bad, you gotta be mad! 
You must have had a proper gutful of propaganda 
To under-overstand what the mad monk means 
When he hits you with the lafta yoga... 
You wanna know what lafta yoga is? 
Erhh herh herh ha ha ha hahhahhahhaa..whooh hooh hah 
Whooh hoo haah ha ha ha ha hah haaaa! 

Back in Mississippi, back in the bible belt... 
A mystic Walter Mitty, but one who was free of guilt! 
Him an, 'is One Love, he who would shake no tit! 
The Klu Klux Klan might turn him into tuna melt!

And you rise
And you're floating in ecstasy
And your eyes
And your eyes are open wide

You'll be dancing to the seven skies
Your eyes are wise, you're wise, you're wise
Your eyes, and you rise...

Learning to turn our fears into hopes
Turning, it's turning the angeless we long for
And a great wind is blowing, it's sowing love
The seed of a new age

And the seed that they're sowing, it's showing us
How we will, will, will be...
Now we're learning how to live to love
To live to love to live

Love to live to love to live
To live love - live love, live love love

Why is the pussy in our well ?
Mustn't be the cat that fell
Where can we find our heart's desire
Living in the fire ?

There was a lion in our glen
Who met a unicorn
Now you were always meant to fly
You are a wingful of eyes",0.0,0.0,0.3581168831168832

Where are you ...
Doncha remember why you came to Everywhere...
The piece of mind that
You came to find has dis-appeared ...
For all that you could take
Was piece of cake and wine ...
And now you'll have to wait
Another time ...

Maybe you're here for the giggle
Maybe you're into the puzzle
Maybe you're blowing the bubble
Maybe you're all in a muddle

The more you know
The more you know you
Don't know what you know
Stone's throw left to go
Bad weather hell for leather
Now and zen you goof again
You never blow your trip forever

Earth mother soul brother
Be high here now
Third eye open soon
Meanwhile new world group soul
Lost and found underground
Next time round

A real weird number
Is Zero the man
Because he a turnin on
Round & round again
They say he'll never make it
But I think he can

There's a hole in the morning
It's the hole that he was born in
Now the old man's yawnin ...

It's the world of illusions
And Zero the Hero
Is up to his ears
In the mysteries ...
No solution to speak of ...
Round & round & round &
Round & round
That's Zero going round again ...
And maybe you come
And maybe you're gone
And maybe you're right
And maybe you're wrong
Maybe you're a one
And maybe you two
And maybe you're free
And dunno what for
Just as long as you're alive
It's all the same
It's all in the name
It's all in the sky and
It doesn't really matter
If you make it
So long as you try
So it's back on the path
Beside the road to everywhere
Gonna jump my horses
Over the weeks to everywhere
And with you we will share
Your sack of cares ...
And if things don't change for
Better or worse
Well man you must be dead
But cha don't have to give up hope
And ya don't have to give up dope (until you do)
And ya don't have to change your ways
You just
Have to
Be what you are my friends
Today ...
That's what the Octave Doctor says ...

So there goes Zero the Hero
Turning on around the wheel of births and deaths
And meanwhile the Octave Doctors
And the Pot Head Pixies and
All the other characters of

yonder to see what's going on

No I never ever ever glid before
I never - oh no

Moon burning slow motion
Waves that you ride
Just to bolster your pride
But if it's love that you're after
The craft of a hero
Will vibe at your side as alone you may glide
With a tiny afterthought
Flashing as the planet calls

I never never glid before

Open up the veil and let us take a peep in
through the moon and diving deep we'll meet the whale
Where rides the captain submarine
Who told the tale of pixies green
That sends us kisses in the brain
And out-far planets never seen
Except by technicolour dream

Belong to him.
Singing O why... Singing O why...

He told me he would teach me everything I tried to know.
He made me see that you and me are dreamers in a show.
And when the days were darkest then he lit them with his moons.
And then we crossed the rainbow bridge but we came back...
Came back too soon...
Singing O why... Singing O why...

He showed me where he was Atman that man I could not see.
He pointed to the sky until a ladder I could see.
I climbed for many lives to find the secret golden flower.
And then I woke and found I'd slept for less than half...
Than half an hour.
Singing O why... Singing O why...

He brought us back together then when I was all alone.
He made me see I was not just of earth and skin and bone.

Now you're back where you belong
Meet the wizard of the keys
And he'll reveal the mysteries

Of Angels' Eggs and Octave Doctors
Radio Gnome and Love Projectors
Then he'll point up in the sky
You will see the Teapots flying
Down the Oily Way...

Down the Oily Way you slide
Through the inner space you ride
Lots and lots of Pot-Head Pixies
Ridin' round in Teapot Taxies

On the Planet Gong they say
If everything goes wrong today
Fill your Teapot up with tea
Come and take a ride with me
Down the oily way...

Oily Way
Oily Way - it's not the milky way
Oily Way - it's not the only way
Oily Way - it's not the English way

Stop !
Wait !
Hey !
Look !

High in the sky, the world you remember
Scenes that we dreamed of
Time for the end of
Hate !
War !
Death !

You big daddy in your big sick city
Gotta choose to loose your games now

Now you're here and now you're Gong
But this ain't me that sings this song
For we the Gong Band it's enough
To be the instruments of love

On which the Octave Doctors play
That we be one and all as one with Gong
On earth and find again
The joys of going around the bend
Down the oily way
