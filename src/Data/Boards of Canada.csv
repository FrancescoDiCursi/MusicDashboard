Just gently as you go
Suggestions are going into your unconscious mind

Open yourself up to the greater wisdom and understanding
So now you're letting the sound of my voice reach the inner
Healthy, receptive center of yourself
See yourself now, in your imagination

You are being transformed in a positive
Healthy way
Slowly you are programming your unconscious mind
Gaining new insight to your directions in the future

Allow yourself to be more aware of your pathway through this life
Enjoy new opportunities 
As the days go by
You will feel it in your mind

You are allowing this to happen
These things are happening day-by-day 
Just as I am telling you they're happening
Wherever you are

See this happening
And trying to become a part of you
More and more rapidly 
More and more surely 

More and more powerfully each day 
When it is necessary
You can program yourself 
And be able to dream the information you require 

This awareness will come gradually at your own rate
It will never be more than you can cope with 
This guidance will help show you the way

There's nothing you can throw at me
That I haven't already heard
I'm just trying to find a decent melody
A song that I can sing

You've got stuck in a moment
And now you can't get out of it
Don't say that later will be better
Now, you're stuck in a moment
And you can't get out of it
I will not forsake, the colors that you bring
But the nights you filled with fireworks
They left you with nothing
I am still enchanted
By the light you brought to me
I still listen through your ears
Through your eyes I can see
You are such a fool to worry like you do
I know it's tough and you can never get enough
Of what you don't really need now, my oh my

You've got yourself stuck in a moment
And you can't get out of it

I wasn't jumping for me it was a fall
