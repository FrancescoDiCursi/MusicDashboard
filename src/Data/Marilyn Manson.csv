Then you flew your Lear jet up to Nova Scotia

Lying cheek to cheek in your cold embrace

So soft and so tragic as a slaughterhouse
You press the knife against your heart
And say that, ""I love you
So much you must kill me now.""
I love you
So much you must kill me now

If I was your vampire, certain as the moon
Instead of killing time, we'll have each other till the sun
If I was your vampire, death waits for no one
Hold my hands across your face because I think our time has come

Digging your smile apart with my spade-tongue
And the hole is where the heart is
We built this tomb together; I will fill it alone
(Beyond the pale everything's black, no turning back)

If I was your vampire, certain as the moon
Instead of killing time, we'll have each other till the sun
If I was your vampire, death waits for no one
Hold my hands across your face because I think our time has come

Blood-stained sheets
In the shape of your heart
This is where it starts
Blood-stained sheets
In the shape of your heart
This is where it starts
This is where it will end
Here comes the moon again

Six-nineteen, and I know I'm ready
Drive me off the mountain; you'll burn, and I'll eat your ashes
Impossible wheels seducing our corpse

If I was your vampire, certain as the moon
Instead of killing time, we'll have each other till the sun
If I was your vampire, death waits for no one
Hold my hands across your face because I think our time has come

You should have picked the photograph; it lasted longer than you

We'll paint the future black if it needs a color
Death sentence is now a story we'll be digging when you finally let me die
Romance of our assassination

Oh grains of the foundation,
So please take my advice,
Of five to eleven servings of bread, cereal or rice,
Three to five of vegetables,
And four fruits is best,
Their antioxidensty fiber help you to digest,
Three servings of yogurt, milk and cheese,
Will help your bones and subsidize the cattle industry

A body needs to grow,
And grow and take regimes,
Why meat can be a tasty treat,
Like fish or even beans

And when you eat your sweets,
Make sure you try,
To limit your servings,
Or you'll

Die!

Hold my hands across your face because I think our time has come

Digging your smile apart with my spade-tongue
And the hole is where the heart is
We built this tomb together; I will fill it alone

In the shape of your heart
This is where it starts
This is where it will end

Six-nineteen, and I know I'm ready
Drive me off the mountain; you'll burn, and I'll eat your ashes
Impossible wheels seducing our corpse

I could have buried all my dead up in her cemetery head
She had dirty word witchcraft; I was in the deep end of her skin
Then, it seemed like a one-car car wreck, but I knew it was a horrid tragedy
Ways to make the tiny satisfaction disappear

[Chorus:]
Blow out the candles
On my Frankensteins
At least my death wish will come true
You taste like Valentine's, and we cry
You're like a birthday:

I could have buried all my dead up in her cemetery head
She had dirty word witchcraft; I was in the deep end of her skin
Then, it seemed like a one-car car wreck, but I knew it was a horrid tragedy
Ways to make the tiny satisfaction disappear

Blow out the candles
On my Frankensteins
At least my death wish will come true
You taste like Valentine's, and we cry
You're like a birthday: 
You should have picked the photograph; it lasted longer than you

Put holes in happiness
We'll paint the future black if it needs a color
Death sentence is now a story we'll be digging when you finally let me die
Romance of our assassination
If you're Bonnie, I'll be your Clyde
But the grass is greener here, and I can see all of your snakes
You wear your ruins well; please, run away with me to hell

It's late September and I really should be back at school
I know I keep you amused, but I feel I'm being used
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more

You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone
You stole my heart and that's what really hurts

The mornin' sun when it's in your face really shows your age
But that don't worry me none, in my eyes, you're everything
I laughed at all of your jokes, my love, you didn't need to coax
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more

You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone
You stole my soul, and that's a pain I can do without

All I needed was a friend to lend a guiding hand
But you turned into a lover, and mother, what a lover, you wore me out
All you did was wreck my bed, and in the morning, kick me in the head
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more

You led me away from home
'Cause you didn't wanna be alone
You stole my heart, I couldn't leave you if I tried

I suppose I could collect my books and get on back to school
Or steal my daddy's cue and make a living out of playin' pool
Or find myself a rock and roll band that needs a helpin' hand
Oh, Maggie, I wished I'd never seen your face

You made a first-class fool out of me
But I'm as blind as a fool can be
You stole my heart, but I love you anyway

Maggie, I wished I'd never seen your face
I'll get on back home one of these days

Keeping me warm night and day

Run away I've got to

Need someone to hold you tight

It's the food pyramid,

Oh grains of the foundation,
So please take my advice,
Of five to eleven servings of bread, cereal or rice,
Three to five of vegetables,
And four fruits is best,
Their antioxidensty fiber help you to digest,
Three servings of yogurt, milk and cheese,
Will help your bones and subsidize the cattle industry

A body needs to grow,
And grow and take regimes,
Why meat can be a tasty treat,
Like fish or even beans

And when you eat your sweets,
Make sure you try,
To limit your servings,
Or you'll

Die!

Everybody!

My body is a pyramid that's made of healthy foods,
So do what we say,

Eat right every day,

So please take my advice,
Of five to eleven servings of bread, cereal or rice,
Three to five of vegetables,
And four fruits is best,
Their antioxidensty fiber help you to digest,
Three servings of yogurt, milk and cheese,
Will help your bones and subsidize the cattle industry

A body needs to grow,
And grow and take regimes,
Why meat can be a tasty treat,
Like fish or even beans

And when you eat your sweets,
Make sure you try,
To limit your servings,
Or you'll

Die!

Everybody!

My body is a pyramid that's made of healthy foods,
So do what we say,

Eat right every day,

Of five to eleven servings of bread, cereal or rice,
Three to five of vegetables,
And four fruits is best,
Their antioxidensty fiber help you to digest,
Three servings of yogurt, milk and cheese,
Will help your bones and subsidize the cattle industry

And grow and take regimes,
Why meat can be a tasty treat,
Like fish or even beans

And when you eat your sweets,
Make sure you try,
To limit your servings,
Or you'll

But they made one contribution that I live by to this day,
It's the food pyramid,
And its approved the USDA

Oh grains of the foundation,
So please take my advice,
Of five to eleven servings of bread, cereal or rice,
Three to five of vegetables,
And four fruits is best,
Their antioxidensty fiber help you to digest,
Three servings of yogurt, milk and cheese,
Will help your bones and subsidize the cattle industry

A body needs to grow,
And grow and take regimes,
Why meat can be a tasty treat,
Like fish or even beans

And when you eat your sweets,
Make sure you try,
To limit your servings,
Or you'll...

DIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Everybody!

My body is a pyramid that's made of healthy foods,

Thinking I gotta f*ck somebody before the week ends
The sight of blood excites me, shoot you in the head 
Sit down, and watch you bleed to death
I hear the sound of your last breath
Shouldn't have been around, I went all the way left
You was in the right place with me at the wrong time
I'm a psychopath, in a minute lose my fucking mind
Calm down, back to reality
Don't fear death, cause I know that it's promised to me
Flashes, I get flashes of Jason
Gimme a knife, a million lives I've wasted
The shadow of death follows me, I don't give a f*ck
(In a mind of a lunatic)
Pussy play Superman, your ass'll get boxed up
Put him in a straight jacket, the man's sick
This is what goes on in the mind of a lunatic

Lookin through her window, now my body is warm
She's naked, and I'm a peepin tom
Her body's beautiful, so I'm thinking rape
Shouldn't have had her curtains open, so that's her fate
Leaving out her house, grabbed the bitch by her mouth
Drug her back in, slammed her down on the couch
Whipped out my knife, said, ""If you scream, I cut you""
Opened her legs and commenced the fucking
She begged me not to kill her so I gave her a rose
Then slit her throat and watched her shake till her eyes closed
(In a mind of a lunatic)
Had sex with the corpse before I left her
And drew my name on the wall like helter skelter
Run for shelter never crossed my mind
I had a gauge, a grenade, and even a nine
Dial 911 for the bitch
But the cops ain't shit
When they're fucking with a mind of a lunatic

I sit alone in my four-cornered room staring at candles
Dreaming of the people I've dismantled
I close my eyes and in the circle 
Appears the images of sons of bitches that I murdered
Flashbacks of bodies being fucked up
Once I attack, I'm like a pit on a rage that's going nuts
Boys used to die when I'm full fo that fry
I be ebbin when I'm high 
So I say 'f*ck' and just let bullets fly
(In a mind of a lunatic)
Like I said before, Scarface is my identity
A homicidal maniac with sucidal tendencies
I'm on the violent tip, so yo get a grip
And bitch, better come equipped, ain't taking no shit 
Cause here comes a mind of a lunatic

My girl's getting skinny, she's strung out on coke
So I went to her mother's house and cut out her throat
Her grandma was standing there, she was screaming out
As she reached for the telly, I put the blade on granny's ass
Went to the back and grabbed a shovel
Now granny's on her way to meet the devil
Pulled out my 38 and aimed at the bitch
A cop says Freeze, mutherfucker ! Bitch, suck my dick
(Mind of a lunatic)
I said, ""Die muthafucker !"" as I blasted 
Something clicked in my head, visions of bodies in plastic
The scent of buckshots in human flesh
Pigs dying from bullet wounds to the chest
No sheriff's gonna take me on a road
Dark as f*ck, and let his pistols explode
F*ck that, cause I ain'ts to die
So I reloaded my Uzi and fired up another fry
It got me crazy as f*ck
A ragin psychotic full of that Angel's Dust
The cops had the place surrounded 
Hunted for a way to get out - and I found it
Innocent bystanders watch me set an example
I popped one, ""Let me go, goddammit
Scot free
Or all of these mutherfuckers coming with me""
(In A Mind of a lunatic)
All of a sudden the shit got silent
I remember waking up, in an asylum
Being treated like a troubled kid
My shirt was all bloody, and both of my wrists was slit
Think this is harsh? This ain't as harsh as it gets
No telling what's being thought up in the mind of a lunatic

Janurary 5th 1969
A damn fool was born with the mind of a lunatic
I shoulda been killed
But sister fucked around and let me live
Now I developed a criminal behaviour
F*ck with me, and I'll slay your ass 
Beyond recognition, shit
Your dental records couldn't prove your identity, bitch
I beg your pardon, on talking to borden
You'll never find a mutherfucker, so save your milk cartons
(In A Mind of a lunatic)
Cross the line, your ass is mine
I don't give a f*ck if you're 9 or 99
Blind, crippled, and crazy, don't faze me
Your funky ass will be pushing up daisies
You wanna know what makes me click?
My psychiatrist said I got the mind of a lunatic

I ain't got it all, so don't f*ck with me
Unless your ass wanna be made history
I'll blow your mutherfucking house up
And if your wife and kids are inside, they're fucked 
I don't give a damn who I slay
Don't let me get a hold of some E&J
Cause when the shit hit the fan
I'll stab your ass quicker than a Mexican
The nightmares I leave you with on the scene
(In A Mind of a lunatic)
Will make Freddy bitch ass look like a wet dream

Sell us ersatz dressed up and real fake

So f*ck all your protests and put them to bed

That suicide is painless

I'm gonna lose it anyway
The losing card I'll someday lay
So this is all I have to say

Suicide is painless (suicide)
It brings on many changes (changes)
And I can take or leave it if I please

The sword of time will pierce our skins
It doesn't hurt when it begins
But as it works its way on in
The pain grows stronger
Watch it grin

And I can take or leave it if I please

To answer questions that are key
Is it to be or not to be
And I replied oh why ask me?

I'm gonna lose it anyway
The losing card I'll someday lay
So this is all I have to say

Suicide is painless (suicide)
It brings on many changes (changes)
And I can take or leave it if I please

The sword of time will pierce our skins
It doesn't hurt when it begins
But as it works its way on in
The pain grows stronger
Watch it grin

Suicide is painless
It brings on many changes
And I can take or leave it if I please

A brave man once requested me
To answer questions that are key
Is it to be or not to be
And I replied oh why ask me?

And our world was so fucking gone

But I'm not attached to your world
Nothing heals and nothing grows

Because it's a great big white world
And we are drained of our colors
We used to love ourselves,
We used to love one another
All my stitches itch
My prescriptions low, I wish you
Were queen
Just for today
In a world so white what else could I say?

And hell was so cold
All the vases are so broken
And the roses tear our hands all open
Mother Mary miscarry
But we pray just like insects
The world is so ugly now

Because it's a great big white world
And we are drained of our colors
We used to love ourselves,
We used to love one another
All my stitches itch
My prescriptions low, I wish you
Were queen

Learn the number seven 
But when they get to you 
It's the first thing that they do 
Each time I look outside 
My mother dies  I feel my back is changing shape 
When the worm consumes the boy it's never 
Considered rape 
When they get to you 
Prick your finger it is done
The moon has now eclipsed the sun
The angel has spread its wings
The time has come for bitter things",0.85,0.0,-0.02833333333333334

Stay  yeah  don't want to go now

Handcrafted housewives into whores 
Fear of the beast is calling it near 

Creating what we're hating  it's only fear that is here

I know the steak is cold but it's wrapped in plastic 

Come into our home, won't you stay? 
I know the steak is cold but it's wrapped in plastic 
I'm only as deep as the self that I dig 
I'm only as sick as the stick in the pig

To wash away sin you must take off your skin 
The righteous father wears the yellowest grin

She's the one who is in an advanced state of shock

She thinks she's in love
She thinks she's in Spain
She isn't in love
She's merely insane

It must be the heat
Or some rare disease
Or too much to eat
Or maybe it's fleas

Keep away from her
Send for Chino!
This is not the
Maria we know!

Modest and pure
Polite and refined
Well-bred and mature
And out of her mind!

A committee
Should be organized to honor me

Lying cheek to cheek in your cold embrace

And say that, ""I love you
So much you must kill me now.""
I love you
So much you must kill me now

Instead of killing time, we'll have each other till the sun
If I was your vampire, death waits for no one
Hold my hands across your face because I think our time has come

Digging your smile apart with my spade-tongue
And the hole is where the heart is
We built this tomb together; I will fill it alone
(Beyond the pale everything's black, no turning back)

If I was your vampire, certain as the moon
Instead of killing time, we'll have each other till the sun
If I was your vampire, death waits for no one
Hold my hands across your face because I think our time has come

Blood-stained sheets
In the shape of your heart
This is where it starts
Blood-stained sheets
In the shape of your heart
This is where it starts
This is where it will end
Here comes the moon again

Six-nineteen, and I know I'm ready
Drive me off the mountain; you'll burn, and I'll eat your ashes
Impossible wheels seducing our corpse

If I was your vampire, certain as the moon
Instead of killing time, we'll have each other till the sun
If I was your vampire, death waits for no one
Hold my hands across your face because I think our time has come

Thinking I gotta f*ck somebody before the week ends
The sight of blood excites me, shoot you in the head 
Sit down, and watch you bleed to death
I hear the sound of your last breath
Shouldn't have been around, I went all the way left
You was in the right place with me at the wrong time
I'm a psychopath, in a minute lose my fucking mind
Calm down, back to reality
Don't fear death, cause I know that it's promised to me
Flashes, I get flashes of Jason
Gimme a knife, a million lives I've wasted
The shadow of death follows me, I don't give a f*ck
(In a mind of a lunatic)
Pussy play Superman, your ass'll get boxed up
Put him in a straight jacket, the man's sick
This is what goes on in the mind of a lunatic

Lookin through her window, now my body is warm
She's naked, and I'm a peepin tom
Her body's beautiful, so I'm thinking rape
Shouldn't have had her curtains open, so that's her fate
Leaving out her house, grabbed the bitch by her mouth
Drug her back in, slammed her down on the couch
Whipped out my knife, said, ""If you scream, I cut you""
Opened her legs and commenced the fucking
She begged me not to kill her so I gave her a rose
Then slit her throat and watched her shake till her eyes closed
(In a mind of a lunatic)
Had sex with the corpse before I left her
And drew my name on the wall like helter skelter
Run for shelter never crossed my mind
I had a gauge, a grenade, and even a nine
Dial 911 for the bitch
But the cops ain't shit
When they're fucking with a mind of a lunatic

I sit alone in my four-cornered room staring at candles
Dreaming of the people I've dismantled
I close my eyes and in the circle 
Appears the images of sons of bitches that I murdered
Flashbacks of bodies being fucked up
Once I attack, I'm like a pit on a rage that's going nuts
Boys used to die when I'm full fo that fry
I be ebbin when I'm high 
So I say 'f*ck' and just let bullets fly
(In a mind of a lunatic)
Like I said before, Scarface is my identity
A homicidal maniac with sucidal tendencies
I'm on the violent tip, so yo get a grip
And bitch, better come equipped, ain't taking no shit 
Cause here comes a mind of a lunatic

My girl's getting skinny, she's strung out on coke
So I went to her mother's house and cut out her throat
Her grandma was standing there, she was screaming out
As she reached for the telly, I put the blade on granny's ass
Went to the back and grabbed a shovel
Now granny's on her way to meet the devil
Pulled out my 38 and aimed at the bitch
A cop says Freeze, mutherfucker ! Bitch, suck my dick
(Mind of a lunatic)
I said, ""Die muthafucker !"" as I blasted 
Something clicked in my head, visions of bodies in plastic
The scent of buckshots in human flesh
Pigs dying from bullet wounds to the chest
No sheriff's gonna take me on a road
Dark as f*ck, and let his pistols explode
F*ck that, cause I ain'ts to die
So I reloaded my Uzi and fired up another fry
It got me crazy as f*ck
A ragin psychotic full of that Angel's Dust
The cops had the place surrounded 
Hunted for a way to get out - and I found it
Innocent bystanders watch me set an example
I popped one, ""Let me go, goddammit
Scot free
Or all of these mutherfuckers coming with me""
(In A Mind of a lunatic)
All of a sudden the shit got silent
I remember waking up, in an asylum
Being treated like a troubled kid
My shirt was all bloody, and both of my wrists was slit
Think this is harsh? This ain't as harsh as it gets
No telling what's being thought up in the mind of a lunatic

Janurary 5th 1969
A damn fool was born with the mind of a lunatic
I shoulda been killed
But sister fucked around and let me live
Now I developed a criminal behaviour
F*ck with me, and I'll slay your ass 
Beyond recognition, shit
Your dental records couldn't prove your identity, bitch
I beg your pardon, on talking to borden
You'll never find a mutherfucker, so save your milk cartons
(In A Mind of a lunatic)
Cross the line, your ass is mine
I don't give a f*ck if you're 9 or 99
Blind, crippled, and crazy, don't faze me
Your funky ass will be pushing up daisies
You wanna know what makes me click?
My psychiatrist said I got the mind of a lunatic

I ain't got it all, so don't f*ck with me
Unless your ass wanna be made history
I'll blow your mutherfucking house up
And if your wife and kids are inside, they're fucked 
I don't give a damn who I slay
Don't let me get a hold of some E&J
Cause when the shit hit the fan
I'll stab your ass quicker than a Mexican
The nightmares I leave you with on the scene
(In A Mind of a lunatic)
Will make Freddy bitch ass look like a wet dream

Up to the top of the hill?

As we were in love

Burn his money
And his house down
And wait for the fire to spread

To turn this all to ashes
Together as one
Against all others
Break all of our wings
And make sure it crashes

Edge of the world
Running, running away
We're running to the edge of the world

I had no choice
To erase the debt of our families
Let you say goodbye
With lips like dynamite
And everyone
Turned their backs
Because they knew
When we held on tight
To each other
We were something fatal
That fell into the wrong hands

Sometimes hate is not enough
To turn this all to ashes
Together as one
Against all others
Break all of your wings
And make sure it crashes

With my spade-tounge.

And I won't fill it alone.

No turning back.

They were as sharp
As we were in love
If god crossed us
We'd take all his drugs
Burn his money
And his house down
And wait for the fire to spread

Sometimes hate is not enough
To turn this all to ashes
Together as one
Against all others
Break all of our wings
And make sure it crashes

Edge of the world
Running, running away
We're running to the edge of the world
I don't know if the world will end today

I had no choice
To erase the debt of our families
Let you say goodbye
With lips like dynamite
And everyone
Turned their backs
Because they knew
When we held on tight
To each other
We were something fatal
That fell into the wrong hands

Sometimes hate is not enough
To turn this all to ashes
Together as one
Against all others
Break all of your wings
And make sure it crashes

Up to the top of the hill?
We had our knives drawn

They were as sharp
As we were in love
If god crossed us
We'd take all his drugs
Burn his money
And his house down
And wait for the fire to spread

Sometimes hate is not enough
To turn this all to ashes
Together as one
Against all others
Break all of our wings
And make sure it crashes

We're running to the
Edge of the world
Running, running away
We're running to the edge of the world
I don't know if the world will end today

I had no choice
To erase the debt of our families
Let you say goodbye
With lips like dynamite
And everyone
Turned their backs
Because they knew
When we held on tight
To each other
We were something fatal
That fell into the wrong hands

Sometimes hate is not enough
To turn this all to ashes
Together as one
Against all others
Break all of your wings
And make sure it crashes

We're running to the edge of the world
Running, running away
We're running to the edge of the world

Up to the top of the hill?
We had our knives drawn

They were as sharp
As we were in love
If god crossed us
We'd take all his drugs
Burn his money
And his house down
And wait for the fire to spread

To turn this all to ashes
Together as one
Against all others
Break all of our wings
And make sure it crashes

Edge of the world
Running, running away
We're running to the edge of the world
I don't know if the world will end today

I had no choice
To erase the debt of our families
Let you say goodbye
With lips like dynamite
And everyone
Turned their backs
Because they knew
When we held on tight
To each other
We were something fatal
That fell into the wrong hands

Sometimes hate is not enough
To turn this all to ashes
Together as one
Against all others
Break all of your wings
And make sure it crashes

It was a day to take the child
Out back and shoot it.
I could have buried all my dead
Up in her cemetery head
She had dirty word witchcraft
I was in the deep end of her skin.
Then, it seemed like a one car car wreck
But I knew it was a horrid tragedy.
Ways to make the tiny satisfaction disappear.

Blow out the candles
On all my Frankensteins.
At least my death wish will come true.
You taste like Valentine's and
We cry,
You're like a birthday.
I should have picked the photograph
It lasted longer than you.

Putting holes in happiness.
We'll paint the future black
If it needs any color.
My death sentence is a story
Who'll be digging when you finally let me die?
The romance of our assassination
If you're Bonnie, I'll be your Clyde.
But the grass is greener here and
I can see all of your snakes.
You wear your ruins well
Please run away with me to hell.

Blow out the candles

But they made one contribution that I live by to this day,
It's the food pyramid,
And its approved the USDA

Oh grains of the foundation,
So please take my advice,
Of five to eleven servings of bread, cereal or rice,
Three to five of vegetables,
And four fruits is best,
Their antioxidensty fiber help you to digest,
Three servings of yogurt, milk and cheese,
Will help your bones and subsidize the cattle industry

A body needs to grow,
And grow and take regimes,
Why meat can be a tasty treat,
Like fish or even beans

And when you eat your sweets,
Make sure you try,
To limit your servings,
Or you'll...

DIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Everybody!

My body is a pyramid that's made of healthy foods,
So do what we say,
(Yeah!)
Eat right every day,
(Food!),

No shadows,
No reflections here.
Lying cheek to cheek
In your cold embrace.

So soft and so tragic
As a slaughterhouse.
You press the knife
Against your heart.
And say,
""I love you, so much you must kill me now.""

I love you
So much
You must kill me now.

If I was your vampire,
Certain as the moon,
Instead of killing time,
We'll have each other
Until the sun.
If I was your vampire,
Death waits for no one.
Hold my hands
Across your face,
Because I think
Our time has come.

Digging your smile apart
With my spade-tounge.
The hole is where the heart is.
We built this tomb together,
And I won't fill it alone.
Beyond the pale
Everything is black,
No turning back.

If I was your vampire,
Certain as the moon,
Instead of killing time,
We'll have each other
Until the sun.

If I was your vampire,
Death waits for no one.
Hold my hands
Across your face,

In the shape of your heart,

Here comes the moon again.

6:19 and I know I'm ready
Drive me off the mountain.
You'll burn,
I'll eat your ashes.
The impossible wheels seducing
Our corpse.

If I was your vampire,
Certain as the moon,
Instead of killing time,
We'll have each other
Until the sun.
If I was your vampire
Death waits for no one.
Hold my hands
Across your face
Because I think
Our time has come.

Beyond the pale
Everything is black
No turning back.

Three to five of vegetables,
And four fruits is best,
Their antioxidensty fiber help you to digest,
Three servings of yogurt, milk and cheese,
Will help your bones and subsidize the cattle industry

And grow and take regimes,
Why meat can be a tasty treat,
Like fish or even beans

And when you eat your sweets,
Make sure you try,
To limit your servings,

Do I follow my instincts blindly
Do I hide my pride from these bad dreams
And give in to sad thoughts that are maddening
Do I sit here and try to stand it
Or do I try to catch them red-handed
To I trust some and get fooled by loneliness
Or do I trust nobody and live in loneliness
Because I can't hold on when I'm stretched so thin
I make the right moves but I'm lost within
I put on my daily façade but then
I just end up getting hurt again

(To anything, watching everything spin)
With thoughts of failure sinking in

If I turn my back, I'm senseless
And to go blindly seemed defenseless
If I hide my pride and let it all go on
Then they'll take from me till everything is gone
If I let them go, I'll be outrun
But if I try to catch them, I'll be outdone
If I'm killed by the questions like a cancer
Then I'll be buried in the silence of the answer

You should have picked the photograph; it lasted longer than you

We'll paint the future black if it needs a color
Death sentence is now a story we'll be digging when you finally let me die

Saw heaven and hell were lies 

When I'm god everybody dies 

Scar/can you feel my power? 

Shoot here and the world gets smaller 

Scar/scar/can you feel my power? 

One shot and the world gets smaller 

Let's jump upon the sharp swords 

And cut away our smiles 

Without the threat of death 

There's no reason to live at all

Do I follow my instincts blindly
Do I hide my pride from these bad dreams
And give in to sad thoughts that are maddening
Do I sit here and try to stand it
Or do I try to catch them red-handed
To I trust some and get fooled by loneliness
Or do I trust nobody and live in loneliness
Because I can't hold on when I'm stretched so thin
I make the right moves but I'm lost within
I put on my daily façade but then
I just end up getting hurt again

I can't hold on
(To anything, watching everything spin)
With thoughts of failure sinking in

If I turn my back, I'm senseless
And to go blindly seemed defenseless
If I hide my pride and let it all go on
Then they'll take from me till everything is gone
If I let them go, I'll be outrun
But if I try to catch them, I'll be outdone
If I'm killed by the questions like a cancer
Then I'll be buried in the silence of the answer

You should have picked the photograph; it lasted longer than you

Put holes in happiness

Death sentence is now a story we'll be digging when you finally let me die

You wear your ruins well; please, run away with me to hell

As we were in love

We'd take all his drugs
Burn his money
And his house down
And wait for the fire to spread

To turn this all to ashes
Together as one
Against all others
Break all of our wings
And make sure it crashes

We're running to the edge of the world

I had no choice
To erase the debt of our families
Let you say goodbye
With lips like dynamite
And everyone
Turned their backs
Because they knew
When we held on tight
To each other
We were something fatal
That fell into the wrong hands

Sometimes hate is not enough
To turn this all to ashes
Together as one
Against all others
Break all of your wings
And make sure it crashes

We'll die alone
Cause I'll break off my own arms
Sharpen my bones
Stab you once for each time I thought of you
Trying to take something
You'll never be good enough to even look upon

It's better to push something away that's slipping
Than to risk being dragged down

If you want to hit bottom
Don't bother to try taking me with you
I won't answer if you call
Two heartbeats ended in hell
Trying to break your fall

This isn't a mob, won't need to change the names
Everyone around you
Has murdered someone, something sacred
Isn't one nail without dirt under it
Isn't any white cotton panties that aren't soaked and stained red

It's better to push something away that's slipping
Than to risk being dragged down

If you want to hit bottom
Don't bother to try taking me with you
I won't answer if you call
Two heartbeats ended in hell
Trying to break your fall
